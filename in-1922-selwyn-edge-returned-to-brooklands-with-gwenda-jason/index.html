Gwenda was the only daughter of Major-General Sir Frederick Glubb, she is shown here on her 250cc Trump-JAP motorcycle. Selwyn Edge's auto was a 5.7 litre Spyker and he averaged 75 mph breaking thirty records for the combined 24 hour run. Edge brushed off the the achievements as a "holiday". Gwenda established the first 'Double 12' on a motorcycle with an average speed of just under 45 mph. She remarked afterward that she was "sustained, by tea and cigarettes". Gwenda was married to Colonel Janson the director of the Spyker car company, but the marriage wouldn't last long and she soon married Colonel Neil Stewart. She then went to the track at Montlhéry, France and established a new 24 hour word record with a Tarrot-JAP motorcycle. While in France she had an affair with Douglas Hawkes one of the mechanics she worked with during her record attempt. She married Hawkes and he bought her a 2-litre a Miller Special race car which she proceeded to break the one mile/kilometre speed record at over 234km/h (145mph) on the oval at Montlhéry between 1930 and 1933. Gwenda raced in the Le Mans 24-Hours twice driving a Maserati engined Derby race car, but without great success. In 1940 Gwenda and Douglas returned to England opening a mechanical engineering factory near Brooklands. Gwenda worked at making artillery shells for the duration of WWII.<br>ref: A Contemporary History of Women's Sport - By Jean Williams<br>ref: Fast Ladies: Female Racing Drivers 1888 to 1970 - By Jean François Bouzanquet</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
