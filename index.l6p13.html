<p>The Harley-Davidson flathead engine started with the Model W's flat-twin, produced from 1919 to 1923 and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder export-model 21-cubic-inch (340 cc) and 30.5-cubic-inch (500 cc) singles and in Servi-Cars until 1973. In 1930, the 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cc) VL flathead replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve configuration. The VL hada single down tube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cc) version (VLH) in 1935. In 1952, the K series flatheads was introduced, designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time, because the AMA allowed the 750 cc sidevalves to compete against 500 cc overhead valve bikes. The K models featured a unit construction engine and transmission case. The K series was replaced by the overhead valve Sportster in 1957. However, racing versions of the 750 cc K model, designated KR, continued to be produced in very limited numbers for some time after, winning both road races and dirt track events against overhead valve bikes limited to 500 cc through 1969, when the AMA finally decided to change the rules and made the flathead uncompetitive. The K racers were replaced first by the iron-head XR 750 cc overhead valve engine, and two years later by the alloy-head XR, which continues in service in flat track racing to this day.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="15"><!-- react-empty: 16 --></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="19"><a class="" data-reactid="20"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="21"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="22"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/528740a99ae999438c4cd38db4c15057/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/528740a99ae999438c4cd38db4c15057/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/06ec6b3c016090eacde6f02038ff398f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="25"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/269dffdf2bf6d2ad45592da8e1ef6e0c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="26"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="670" data-ratio="1.182089552238806" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/528740a99ae999438c4cd38db4c15057/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="27"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><!-- react-empty: 32 --><!-- react-empty: 33 --><div class="Paragraph b { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;9a1c7e2e-6c7b-42a2-a67a-508b278ed60d&quot;, &quot;item&quot;: &quot;b1a9e8ea-9548-4d04-9939-ac4e31f3ea30&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;src&quot;: null, &quot;created_at&quot;: null, &quot;updated_at&quot;: null, &quot;ctaType&quot;: undefined, &quot;_title&quot;: undefined, &quot;_caption&quot;: undefined, &quot;_text&quot;: &quot;Tazio Nuvolari in 1926 on his Bianchi Freccia Celeste (light blue arrow) 350.

<p>A 1954 Honda Dream showed up at the Vintage Motorcycle Days event this weekend. Manufactured only for the Japanese market the 220cc four stroke over head valve motorcycle was a quite remarkable accomplishment in Japan's post WWII recovery and helped secure Honda's future. In 1922 at 15 years old Soichiro Honda (the Old Man) became an apprentice at Art Shokai one of Tokyo’s top automobile and motorcycle repair workshops. At the time most automobiles and motorcycles in Japan were foreign-made. In 1923, the Art Shokai started to make race cars, one of the cars built at the shop is in Honda's collection. It was built using a US built Mitchell automotive chassis and a secondhand Curtiss "Jenny" A1 biplane motor. Soichiro Honda was able to dodge military service in WWI because he was found to be color blind. In 1936 Honda and a partner started new venture 'Tokai Seiki' with the intent to manufacture piston rings while still working at Art Shokai. But by 1941 Japan was heading to war in the Pacific and the company was placed in control of the government. During the build up to war Honda invented an automatic milling machine for wooden aircraft propellers, a job previously done by hand. A single propeller produced by hand took a week to make but now it was possible to turn out two every thirty minutes.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="80"><!-- react-empty: 81 --></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="82"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="83"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="84"><a class="" data-reactid="85"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="86"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="87"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d499275a27e62c04ab05881154cf4b9a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F99ab811a-71f0-405d-b90a-b69fc861812f.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:84.02777777777779% 42.50841750841751%;" data-reactid="88"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d499275a27e62c04ab05881154cf4b9a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F99ab811a-71f0-405d-b90a-b69fc861812f.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:84.02777777777779% 42.50841750841751%;" data-reactid="89"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5b693a21b0d37b351108528b95fc833b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F99ab811a-71f0-405d-b90a-b69fc861812f.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:84.02777777777779% 42.50841750841751%;" data-reactid="90"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bc82f8fda5026ac5902be8d020b0fab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F99ab811a-71f0-405d-b90a-b69fc861812f.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:84.02777777777779% 42.50841750841751%;" data-reactid="91"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="594" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d499275a27e62c04ab05881154cf4b9a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F99ab811a-71f0-405d-b90a-b69fc861812f.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:84.02777777777779% 42.50841750841751%;" data-reactid="92"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="93"><!-- react-empty: 94 --><!-- react-empty: 95 --><!-- react-empty: 96 --><!-- react-empty: 97 --><!-- react-empty: 98 --><div class="Paragraph b { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5960eefc-7ba8-44d6-a04d-d420e18a2780&quot;, &quot;item&quot;: &quot;5b86301b-d96c-4cef-ab46-370a1699f436&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;src&quot;: null, &quot;created_at&quot;: null, &quot;updated_at&quot;: null, &quot;ctaType&quot;: undefined, &quot;_title&quot;: undefined, &quot;_caption&quot;: undefined, &quot;_text&quot;: &quot;So this is interesting...Cees Fick from Holland stuffed a 750 Harley-Davidson WLA surplus WWII engine in a Norton featherbed frame and transplanted Matchless cylinder heads on the beast!

At the 1931 Senior TT, Norton would win the first three positions. Tim Hunt won the Senior while Guthrie who had slid-off at the Governor's Bridge on lap 5, finished in 2nd place at an average speed of 77.34 mph (124.47 km/h). Fellow Norton team-mate Stanley Woods finished in 3rd place with a glove stuffed in the fuel tank filler, having lost the cap on the course. At the 1932 TT it was Norton again with Stanley Woods, Jimmie Guthrie, and Jimmie Simpson in first second and third place finishes in the senior. Norton continued to dominate the Senior TT in 1933 with Woods, Simpson, Hunt and Guthrie taking the top 4 positions in that order. Jimmie Guthrie would win the 1934 Senior and Junior TT for Norton with team-mate Jimmie Simpson coming in second in both races as well. Stanley Woods had left Norton in 1934 to race for Husqvarna and moved to Moto Guzzi in 1935 winning the Senior TT for the Italians with Guthrie, Walter Rusk and John Duncan taking second, third and forth for Norton. Woods won the 1935 Senior TT Race by 4 seconds from Jimmie Guthrie in 3 hours, 7 minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68 mph (136.28 km/h). This photo is Jimmie Guthrie after winning the 1936 Senior TT. Moto Guzzi was involved in war production for the crisis in Abyssinia, so Stanley Woods rode for Velocette in the 1936 taking second place in the Senior with Freddie Frith riding for Norton coming in third. Freddie would win the 1937 Senior for Norton and Jimmie Guthrie would win the Junior.

It had been just a couple of weeks after the "Motogiro d'Italia" that Taglioni decided to increase the 100 to 125cc, for a slightly more powerful version of the Gran Sport. But inspite Maoggi's added power, Degli Antoni on a 100cc Marianna won the race with an astounding average of 103.172 km/hr, while Maoggi finished in 21st place. It was this loss that motivated Taglioni to design a double overhead camshaft engine. Giuliano Maoggi would get a dohc 125cc ride and was named the overall winner of the 1956 Motogiro. At the Swedish GP in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 spectators Degli Antoni finished the race in 1st place at a record-breaking speed of 48 minutes and 8.1 seconds on the dohc 125cc Grand Sport. With this spectacular victory, Degli Antoni became known as an "unbeatable rider" and Ducati won the respect of their competition. In 1958, a year before its official withdrawal from competition Ducati came out with the Triple-camshaft single-cylinder Desmo 125 that Taglioni worked to perfect since 1956. He also developed the Twin-cylinder which came in third at Monza and was designing a double-camshaft four-cylinder!</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="225"><!-- react-empty: 226

1947, the inventor of the Vespa, aircraft designer Corradino D'Ascanio, came up with the idea of building a light three-wheeled commercial vehicle to power Italy's post WWII economic reconstruction, an idea which found favor with Enrico Piaggio, the son of the firm's founder, Rinaldo.
