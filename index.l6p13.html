</picture><p>The Harley-Davidson flathead engine started with the Model W's flat-twin, produced from 1919 to 1923 and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder export-model 21-cubic-inch (340 cc) and 30.5-cubic-inch (500 cc) singles and in Servi-Cars until 1973. In
    1930, the 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cc) VL flathead replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve configuration. The VL hada single down tube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cc) version
    (VLH) in 1935. In 1952, the K series flatheads was introduced, designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time, because the AMA allowed the 750 cc sidevalves to compete against 500 cc overhead valve bikes. The K models featured a
    unit construction engine and transmission case. The K series was replaced by the overhead valve Sportster in 1957. However, racing versions of the 750 cc K model, designated KR, continued to be produced in very limited numbers for some time after,
    winning both road races and dirt track events against overhead valve bikes limited to 500 cc through 1969, when the AMA finally decided to change the rules and made the flathead uncompetitive. The K racers were replaced first by the iron-head XR 750
    cc overhead valve engine, and two years later by the alloy-head XR, which continues in service in flat track racing to this day.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-b1a9e8ea-9548-4d04-9939-ac4e31f3ea30" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="17"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ms-w-66p" data-reactid="18"><a class=" " href="tazio-nuvolari-in-1926-on-his-bianchi-freccia-celeste-light" data-reactid="19"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="20"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="21"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/528740a99ae999438c4cd38db4c15057/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/528740a99ae999438c4cd38db4c15057/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/06ec6b3c016090eacde6f02038ff398f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/269dffdf2bf6d2ad45592da8e1ef6e0c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="25"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="670" data-ratio="1.182089552238806" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/528740a99ae999438c4cd38db4c15057/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a43f02d-3d4b-484d-a425-bf5adc8b67ad.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.68939393939394% 12.761194029850747%;" data-reactid="26"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-h-5 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><!-- react-empty: 32 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="33"><p>Tazio Nuvolari in 1926 on his Bianchi Freccia Celeste (light blue arrow) 350.

</picture><p>Tazio Nuvolari was known in his village as “the son of the devil” (il figlio del diabolo) because of his many dangerous exploits with bicycles, motorcycles and later cars. During the first world war he served in the Italian Army as a driver and he started
    racing motorcycles after the war when he was 28. In 1922 he won the Campionato Mantovano Motociclistico on a Harley-Davidson. In 1923 he was unbeatable with 8 first place finishes riding at times a Garelli 350, a Norton M18 in 500cc events and a 1000cc
    Indian Powerplus. His riding was noticed by the Bianchi team and he became a works rider and eventually Italian champion. At the Monza motorcycle Grand Prix he crashed during practice breaking both legs. After doctors put plaster casts on both legs
    he was told that it would be at least one month before he could walk again let alone race motorcycles. The next day he started the race having himself tied to his bike. His mechanics had to hold him upright at the start of the race and to catch him
    at the end...he won the race! From 1925 on he mostly competed on a Bianchi Freccia Celeste 350 motorcycle winning every race he entered. Nuvolari began racing cars in 1924 at the age of 32 while still competing in motorcycles. In 1927 Tazio and another
    motorcycle racer Achille Varzi purchased a pair of Bugatti 35Bs and started their own automotive race team.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37

</picture><p>A 1954 Honda Dream showed up at the Vintage Motorcycle Days event this weekend. Manufactured only for the Japanese market the 220cc four stroke over head valve motorcycle was a quite remarkable accomplishment in Japan's post WWII recovery and helped secure
    Honda's future. In 1922 at 15 years old Soichiro Honda (the Old Man) became an apprentice at Art Shokai one of Tokyo’s top automobile and motorcycle repair workshops. At the time most automobiles and motorcycles in Japan were foreign-made. In 1923,
    the Art Shokai started to make race cars, one of the cars built at the shop is in Honda's collection. It was built using a US built Mitchell automotive chassis and a secondhand Curtiss "Jenny" A1 biplane motor. Soichiro Honda was able to dodge military
    service in WWI because he was found to be color blind. In 1936 Honda and a partner started new venture 'Tokai Seiki' with the intent to manufacture piston rings while still working at Art Shokai. But by 1941 Japan was heading to war in the Pacific
    and the company was placed in control of the government. During the build up to war Honda invented an automatic milling machine for wooden aircraft propellers, a job previously done by hand. A single propeller produced by hand took a week to make
    but now it was possible to turn out two every thirty minutes.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="65"><!-- react-empty: 66 --></div></section><section

Some of the engines ended up in sport bikes and others in choppers ofthat era.

At the 1931 Senior TT, Norton would win the first three positions. Tim Hunt won the Senior while Guthrie who had slid-off at the Governor's
    Bridge on lap 5, finished in 2nd place at an average speed of 77.34 mph (124.47 km/h). Fellow Norton team-mate Stanley Woods finished in 3rd place with a glove stuffed in the fuel tank filler, having lost the cap on the course. At the 1932 TT it was
    Norton again with Stanley Woods, Jimmie Guthrie, and Jimmie Simpson in first second and third place finishes in the senior. Norton continued to dominate the Senior TT in 1933 with Woods, Simpson, Hunt and Guthrie taking the top 4 positions in that
    order. Jimmie Guthrie would win the 1934 Senior and Junior TT for Norton with team-mate Jimmie Simpson coming in second in both races as well. Stanley Woods had left Norton in 1934 to race for Husqvarna and moved to Moto Guzzi in 1935 winning the
    Senior TT for the Italians with Guthrie, Walter Rusk and John Duncan taking second, third and forth for Norton. Woods won the 1935 Senior TT Race by 4 seconds from Jimmie Guthrie in 3 hours, 7 minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68 mph
    (136.28 km/h). This photo is Jimmie Guthrie after winning the 1936 Senior TT. Moto Guzzi was involved in war production for the crisis in Abyssinia, so Stanley Woods rode for Velocette in the 1936 taking second place in the Senior with Freddie Frith
    riding for Norton coming in third. Freddie would win the 1937 Senior for Norton and Jimmie Guthrie would win the Junior. Jimmie Guthrie, was killed during the German Grand Prix later that year.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="96"><!-- react-empty: 97 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-d309e4ff-e2be-46db-bc60-1619d14d3216" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="98"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="99"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="100"><a class=" " href="charles-chook-hodgekiss-coupled-two-500cc-jap-motors-in" data-reactid="101"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="102"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="103"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b394c904b43510bfc573b2bd0791263d/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb6b52bb-12b7-48a6-835e-6d5af4f81a43.png&amp;width=792" style="object-position:10.164141414141415% 48.90310786106033%;" data-reactid="104"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b394c904b43510bfc573b2bd0791263d/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb6b52bb-12b7-48a6-835e-6d5af4f81a43.png&amp;width=792" style="object-position:10.164141414141415% 48.90310786106033%;" data-reactid="105"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a830c9ed79fd39bb8a9eaf3537139f/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb6b52bb-12b7-48a6-835e-6d5af4f81a43.png&amp;width=720" style="object-position:10.164141414141415% 48.90310786106033%;" data-reactid="106"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/67bab4e3a368bf6100c4715a42929a66/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb6b52bb-12b7-48a6-835e-6d5af4f81a43.png&amp;width=360" style="object-position:10.164141414141415% 48.90310786106033%;" data-reactid="107"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="547" data-ratio="1.4478976234003655" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b394c904b43510bfc573b2bd0791263d/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffb6b52bb-12b7-48a6-835e-6d5af4f81a43.png&amp;width=792" style="object-position:10.164141414141415% 48.90310786106033%;" data-reactid="108"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="109"><!-- react-empty: 110 --><!-- react-empty: 111 --><!-- react-empty: 112 --><!-- react-empty: 113 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="114"><!-- react-text: 115 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="116"><p data-reactid="117">Charles ‘Chook’ Hodgekiss - Dual 500cc J.A.P. </p></div><a class=" " href="charles-chook-hodgekiss-coupled-two-500cc-jap-motors-in" data-reactid="118"><!-- react-empty: 119 --></a><!-- react-empty: 120 --><!-- react-empty: 121 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="122"><p>Charles ‘Chook’ Hodgekiss coupled two 500cc J.A.P. motors in tandem to create his distinctive sidecar speedway racers. Although the sidecar rig doesn't appear to be fitted in this photo I don't believe Chook ever raced solo on one of these contraption's. Douglas and Rudge motorcycles dominated speedway's formative years, before the arrival of the ‘Speedway JAP’ engine in 1930's. The J.A.P. was a proprietary engine, and as such available to every builder/racer. There was even one Aussie racer that built a Speedcar with 3 JAP engines! In 1955 a 500cc JAP Speedway engine could be purchased for under 100 £ ($156.00).<br>Photo via Steve Margo who got it from Barbara Keir "Ckook's" daughter<br>Check out Steve's blog<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/184768618290981/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/184768618290981/</a></p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-02a5fb69-9de7-4d4c-afbc-f3af36ac0198" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="123"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="124"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="125"><a class=" " href="from-may-to-august-of-1935-joe-petrali-won-every-class-a-na" data-reactid="126"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="127"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="128"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d7fd21bd3720ed361682c120081befcc/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fac3f2ff8-e6bb-4abb-97b8-f859859b76c6.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:26.262626262626267% 10.181818181818182%;" data-reactid="129"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d7fd21bd3720ed361682c120081befcc/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fac3f2ff8-e6bb-4abb-97b8-f859859b76c6.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:26.262626262626267% 10.181818181818182%;" data-reactid="130"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ec1fce11532e53a0827934b86f6d02a3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fac3f2ff8-e6bb-4abb-97b8-f859859b76c6.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:26.262626262626267% 10.181818181818182%;" data-reactid="131"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8f3bfd3a5dde466b61ed9807b5871598/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fac3f2ff8-e6bb-4abb-97b8-f859859b76c6.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:26.262626262626267% 10.181818181818182%;" data-reactid="132"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="550" data-ratio="1.44" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d7fd21bd3720ed361682c120081befcc/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fac3f2ff8-e6bb-4abb-97b8-f859859b76c6.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:26.262626262626267% 10.181818181818182%;" data-reactid="133"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="134"><!-- react-empty: 135 --><!-- react-empty: 136 --><!-- react-empty: 137 --><!-- react-empty: 138 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="139"><!-- react-text: 140 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="141"><p data-reactid="142">Joe Petrali - Hank Syvertsen</p></div><a class=" " href="from-may-to-august-of-1935-joe-petrali-won-every-class-a-na" data-reactid="143"><!-- react-empty: 144 --></a><!-- react-empty: 145 --><!-- react-empty: 146 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="147"><p>From May to August of 1935, Joe Petrali won every Class A national race, 10 in a row!

aircraft designer Corradino D'Ascanio, came up with the idea of building a light three-wheeled commercial vehicle to power Italy's post WWII economic reconstruction, an idea which found favor with Enrico Piaggio, the son of the firm's founder, Rinaldo. The very first Ape (Italian for honeybee, think Apis mellifera) were mechanically a Vespa with two wheels addedto the rear, with a flat-bed structure on top of the rear axle. By 1956 the Ape had a cab to protect the driver from the elements. The Model "C" (1956 – 1963) came in no less than eight different body styles. The Ape has been in continuous production since its inception and has been produced in Italy and India.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-3d40f33c-da71-4d82-9d33-2d4c8ea06e69" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="221"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="222"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/84d80c06-ef13-4f60-ac2b-a72a294de737.jpg" alt="Ducati 100cc Marianna"><p>For the 1955 "Milano-Taranto race", Ducati works riders Alberto Gandossi and Francesco Villa rode 100cc Mariannas but Giuliano Maoggi would get a 125cc Gran Sport. It had been just a couple of weeks after the "Motogiro d'Italia" that Taglioni decided
    to increase the 100 to 125cc, for a slightly more powerful version of the Gran Sport. But inspite Maoggi's added power, Degli Antoni on a 100cc Marianna won the race with an astounding average of 103.172 km/hr, while Maoggi finished in 21st place.
    It was this loss that motivated Taglioni to design a double overhead camshaft engine. Giuliano Maoggi would get a dohc 125cc ride and was named the overall winner of the 1956 Motogiro. At the Swedish GP in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 spectators
    Degli Antoni finished the race in 1st place at a record-breaking speed of 48 minutes and 8.1 seconds on the dohc 125cc Grand Sport. With this spectacular victory, Degli Antoni became known as an "unbeatable rider" and Ducati won the respect of their
    competition. In 1958, a year before its official withdrawal from competition Ducati came out with the Triple-camshaft single-cylinder Desmo 125 that Taglioni worked to perfect since 1956. He also developed the Twin-cylinder which came in third at
    Monza and was designing a double-camshaft four-cylinder!</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="223"><!-- react-empty: 224 --></div></section><section

In 1930, the 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cc) VL flathead replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve configuration. The VL hada single down tube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cc) version (VLH) in 1935. In 1952, the K series flatheads was introduced, designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time, because the AMA allowed the 750 cc sidevalves to compete against 500 cc overhead valve bikes. The K models featured a unit construction engine and transmission case. The K series was replaced by the overhead valve Sportster in 1957. However, racing versions of the 750 cc K model, designated KR, continued to be produced in very limited numbers for some time after, winning both road races and dirt track events against overhead valve bikes limited to 500 cc through 1969, when the AMA finally decided to change the rules and made the flathead uncompetitive. The K racers were replaced first by the iron-head XR 750 cc overhead valve engine, and two years later by the alloy-head XR, which continues in service in flat track racing to this day.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"388d2872-9593-4245-83ae-91b312b945da","item":"8c314363-b2be-4b9c-adf3-c9712f0265b6","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4419ef59ca0da0b43d32904017d3ab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4419ef59ca0da0b43d32904017d3ab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e56de8ffe528725789bb2515a7458ab2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a43357a91d8bd318fa0da6857a57ce8e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4419ef59ca0da0b43d32904017d3ab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=792\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4419ef59ca0da0b43d32904017d3ab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/a6ad11ad4d35e42fd47d66b87e39bb6d.png","ratio":"132:91","aspect":1.4505494505494505,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":546,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4419ef59ca0da0b43d32904017d3ab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4419ef59ca0da0b43d32904017d3ab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e56de8ffe528725789bb2515a7458ab2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a43357a91d8bd318fa0da6857a57ce8e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F824576c8-aff6-4174-88a8-e8aca376f5ba.jpg&width=360"}],"faces":[{"x":617,"y":501,"width":30,"height":30,"confidence":5.045647},{"x":726,"y":355,"width":38,"height":38,"confidence":5.026145},{"x":721,"y":447,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":5.025155},{"x":731,"y":387,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":5.003369},{"x":653,"y":459,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.003252},{"x":668,"y":475,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.001466},{"x":484,"y":269,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.001294},{"x":561,"y":503,"width":30,"height":30,"confidence":4.999419},{"x":761,"y":417,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":4.998334}],"colors":[[243,235,224],[193,184,169],[147,138,123],[8,0,0],[92,83,68]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[91,69],[698,545]],"confidence":0.141866,"center":[395,323],"radius":313.578},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"2ab4820e-07ba-4cb4-8331-11736c5abf16","item":"8c314363-b2be-4b9c-adf3-c9712f0265b6","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"The Harley-Davidson flathead engine started with the Model W's flat-twin, produced from 1919 to 1923 and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder export-model 21-cubic-inch (340 cc) and 30.5-cubic-inch (500 cc) singles and in Servi-Cars until 1973.

During the first world war he served in the Italian Army as a driver and he started racing motorcycles after the war when he was 28. In 1922 he won the Campionato Mantovano Motociclistico on a Harley-Davidson. In 1923 he was unbeatable with 8 first place finishes riding at times a Garelli 350, a Norton M18 in 500cc events and a 1000cc Indian Powerplus. His riding was noticed by the Bianchi team and he became a works rider and eventually Italian champion. At the Monza motorcycle Grand Prix he crashed during practice breaking both legs. After doctors put plaster casts on both legs he was told that it would be at least one month before he could walk again let alone race motorcycles.

1954 Honda Dream showed up at the Vintage Motorcycle Days event this weekend. Manufactured only for the Japanese market the 220cc four stroke over head valve motorcycle was a quite remarkable accomplishment in Japan's post WWII recovery and helped secure Honda's future. In 1922 at 15 years old Soichiro Honda (the Old Man) became an apprentice at Art Shokai one of Tokyo’s top automobile and motorcycle repair workshops. At the time most automobiles and motorcycles in Japan were foreign-made. In 1923, the Art Shokai started to make race cars, one of the cars built at the shop is in Honda's collection. It was built using a US built Mitchell automotive chassis and a secondhand Curtiss \"Jenny\" A1 biplane motor. Soichiro Honda was able to dodge military service in WWI because he was found to be color blind. In 1936 Honda and a partner started new venture 'Tokai Seiki' with the intent to manufacture piston rings while still working at Art Shokai. But by 1941 Japan was heading to war in the Pacific and the company was placed in control of the government.

At the 1931 Senior TT, Norton would win the first three positions. Tim Hunt won the Senior while Guthrie who had slid-off at the Governor's Bridge on lap 5, finished in 2nd place at an average speed of 77.34 mph (124.47 km/h). Fellow Norton team-mate Stanley Woods finished in 3rd place with a glove stuffed in the fuel tank filler, having lost the cap on the course. At the 1932 TT it was Norton again with Stanley Woods, Jimmie Guthrie, and Jimmie Simpson in first second and third place finishes in the senior. Norton continued to dominate the Senior TT in 1933 with Woods, Simpson, Hunt and Guthrie taking the top 4 positions in that order. Jimmie Guthrie would win the 1934 Senior and Junior TT for Norton with team-mate Jimmie Simpson coming in second in both races as well. Stanley Woods had left Norton in 1934 to race for Husqvarna and moved to Moto Guzzi in 1935 winning the Senior TT for the Italians with Guthrie, Walter Rusk and John Duncan taking second, third and forth for Norton. Woods won the 1935 Senior TT Race by 4 seconds from Jimmie Guthrie in 3 hours, 7 minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68 mph (136.28 km/h). This photo is Jimmie Guthrie after winning the 1936 Senior TT.

It had been just a couple of weeks after the \"Motogiro d'Italia\" that Taglioni decided to increase the 100 to 125cc, for a slightly more powerful version of the Gran Sport. But inspite Maoggi's added power, Degli Antoni on a 100cc Marianna won the race with an astounding average of 103.172 km/hr, while Maoggi finished in 21st place. It was this loss that motivated Taglioni to design a double overhead camshaft engine. Giuliano Maoggi would get a dohc 125cc ride and was named the overall winner of the 1956 Motogiro. At the Swedish GP in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 spectators Degli Antoni finished the race in 1st place at a record-breaking speed of 48 minutes and 8.1 seconds on the dohc 125cc Grand Sport.
