The new design had retained the same internal components but the parallel cylinders were now angled upward at a 45 degree angle providing better cooling and a shorter wheelbase. The distinctive spiked cooling fins that gave the original E90 it’s nickname were now gone on the new design but race fans and the racing press continued to refer to the new E95 as a “Porcupine”. The new machine sported a huge “full gallon” fuel tank that extended down on both sides of the engine further lowering the center of gravity and providing some streamlining with deep cutouts for the riders knees. A fuel pump was now needed to raise petrol to the carburetors. This arrangement also meant that to start the bike the pit crew would stand the bike vertically balancing it on the rear wheel to flood the float chambers with fuel. Two 28.6 mm Amal GP carbs feed the 68mm bore x 68.5mm stroke, almost square engine. It now also featured a long underslung oil sump, and pressed-up crankshaft with one-piece connecting rods and roller big-ends. At the 1949 Isle of Man TT Leslie Graham was forced to retire just two minutes from the finish line with a failure of it’s gear driven magneto on the AJS E90. The E95 adopted a chain driven aircraft magneto which solved that problem. The camshaft housing and various engine covers were magnesium alloy as were the front and rear hubs. The E95 was first raced at the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix with Jack Brett taking first place, Bill Doran in second and Rod Coleman coming in 5th at the season opener. But by 1953 the AJS was relegated to tenth place so for the 1954 season AMC’s new development engineer Jack Williams continued development on the bike lowering the engine in the frame and getting 54bhp at 7,800rpm from the engine. The riders for the 1954 season were Bob McIntyre, Derek Farrant and Rod Coleman with Coleman finishing second at Ulster and winning the Swedish Grand Prix. In 1954 Charlie Collier the founder of AMC died and AJS withdrew from GP racing at the end of the season. The Porcupine racers of which only four E90 and four E95’s were built had entered 24 GP races winning 5 and coming in second in seven with one World Championship in 1949. Only one E90 machine survives, the factory scrapped the others, thankfully all four E95 machines. A 1954 AJS E95 Porcupine was sold post-auction at Bonham’s in 2011, for a reputed $675,000!</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="15"><!-- react-empty: 16 --></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="19"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="20"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="21"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a85024633164c286164c6a8d3b47d937/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F65d52202-7f0a-47dd-a933-d693cc516043.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.5530303030303% 61.07011070110702%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a85024633164c286164c6a8d3b47d937/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F65d52202-7f0a-47dd-a933-d693cc516043.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.5530303030303% 61.07011070110702%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c923d9d35b13d1140eca6f33d9740be/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F65d52202-7f0a-47dd-a933-d693cc516043.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:61.5530303030303% 61.07011070110702%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/06d888084e9dba111908659ad6ab7ac2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F65d52202-7f0a-47dd-a933-d693cc516043.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:61.5530303030303% 61.07011070110702%;" data-reactid="25"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="542" data-ratio="1.4612546125461254" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a85024633164c286164c6a8d3b47d937/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F65d52202-7f0a-47dd-a933-d693cc516043.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.5530303030303% 61.07011070110702%;" data-reactid="26"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="32"><!-- react-text: 33 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m #{styles}" data-reactid="34"><p data-reactid="35">Giacomo Agostini and Mike Hailwood</p></div><!-- react-empty: 36 --><!-- react-empty: 37 --><!-- react-empty: 38 --></div><div class="Paragraph color-text ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="39"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="40">The classic battle between Giacomo Agostini and &quot;Mike the Bike&quot; Hailwood. Ago won 10 Isle of Man TTs and Hailwood was winner 14 times at the TT. It would be Agostini who in 1972 having lost so many friends at the Isle of Man, put up his hands and said that the circuit was too dangerous. In 1977 the race was removed from the World Championship calendar. Racing in the 1960s and 1970s was a very dangerous sport, the concern for safety was not like it is today so the possibility of dying at the track was very real. Agostini had an incredible 122 Grand Prix wins in his career. Mike Hailwood was a nine-time World Champion, and winner of 76 career Grand Prixs. Mike even came out of retirement after an 11-year absence and, against all odds, won the Isle of Man in 1978. Yeah I&#x27;d say any battle on the track between these titans of two wheels is going to be classic.</span></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="41"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ls-w-33p" data-reactid="43"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="44"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="45"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c8da88fe7f616acc91d2ecdafcefe0d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7f5dda7c-8724-4c6b-9f8c-5b1b778d2192.jpg&amp;width=581" style="object-position:83.99311531841653% 26.01010101010101%;" data-reactid="46"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c8da88fe7f616acc91d2ecdafcefe0d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7f5dda7c-8724-4c6b-9f8c-5b1b778d2192.jpg&amp;width=581" style="object-position:83.99311531841653% 26.01010101010101%;" data-reactid="47"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c8da88fe7f616acc91d2ecdafcefe0d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7f5dda7c-8724-4c6b-9f8c-5b1b778d2192.jpg&amp;width=581" style="object-position:83.99311531841653% 26.01010101010101%;" data-reactid="48"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4b4e191b6786d6e76b47ce311e87e030/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7f5dda7c-8724-4c6b-9f8c-5b1b778d2192.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:83.99311531841653% 26.01010101010101%;" data-reactid="49"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="581" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.7335858585858586" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c8da88fe7f616acc91d2ecdafcefe0d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7f5dda7c-8724-4c6b-9f8c-5b1b778d2192.jpg&amp;width=581" style="object-position:83.99311531841653% 26.01010101010101%;" data-reactid="50"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column ls-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ls-p-h-8 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><!-- react-empty: 55 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="56"><!-- react-text: 57 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m #{styles}" data-reactid="58"><p data-reactid="59">Naomi Taniguchi on the Honda RC142</p></div><!-- react-empty: 60 --><!-- react-empty: 61 --><!-- react-empty: 62 --></div><div class="Paragraph color-text ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="63"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="64">Naomi Taniguchi on the Honda RC142 at the 1959 Isle of Man TT where he placed 6th and became the first Japanese racer to compete at the world championship level. The RC142 works machine was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, DOHC, 4-valve, 2-cylinder 125cc engine that borrowed heavily from the NSU Rennmax. Taniguchi finished sixth, more than 7 minutes behind MV-mounted race winner Tarquino Provini. 1959 was the last year 125s raced the short course, rather than the more-demanding Snaefell Mountain circuit. Honda won the Constructor’s Prize with Taniguchi in 6th, Giichi Suzuki placed 7th, and Junzo Suzuki finished 11th. Honda motorcycles eventually scored seven individual TT victories and more than a dozen world championships, in every displacement category from 50 to 500cc, before withdrawing from international motorcycle competition in &#x27;67 to focus on Formula 1 car racing.

Motorcycle design just prior to WW2 was advancing at a staggering pace with all kinds of unusual and revolutionary engine layouts being developed. Collier &amp; Sons launched their AJS 500cc V-4 at the Olympia Motor Cycle Show in London in 1935. Designed by Bert Collier, the AJS design was similar to another V-4 Collier engine design, the 1931 593cc Matchless 'Silver Hawk'. The AJS V-4 was technologically advanced 500cc 50º chain-driven SOHC engine, with exposed 'hairpin' valve springs. Although it debuted at the Olympia show as a tourer the machine never went into production and only a few bikes were built. In the spring of 1936 AJS began testing a new racing version of the V-4 at Brooklands. The new machine now had alloy barrels and sported a supercharger designed by Swiss engineer Arnold Zoller. The supercharged V4 produced 55hp and had a top speed of 135mph, it was designed to compete against BMW's Kompressor machines. BMW had been developing supercharged racers for sometime, starting in 1929 with Ernest Henne's 134.6 mph land speed record. The AJS V-4's supercharger was mounted in the front and was driven at half engine speed, and fed by a single Amal TT carburetor. The engine was mounted in the same frame as the 500 cc OHC single TT racers, and used a four-speed Burman gearbox with a dry clutch. Harold Daniell and George Rowley rode the AJS supercharged V4s in the Isle of Man Senior TT, but despite its high top speed, it was heavy, and did not handle well. The bikes were also plagued with carbonation troubles and lacked acceleration. Both riders retired due to mechanical problems. Single cylinder machines would again dominate the TT with Freddie Firth winning on his Norton with a record speed. AJS would continue to develop the V-4 turning to liquid cooling in 1939 utilizing a cast alloy engine with enclosed valve springs. Between 1936 and 1939, the AJS V-4 set several records, breaking the 100 mph lap speed record at the Ulster Grand Prix.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="73"><!-- react-empty: 74 --></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="75"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="76"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7315c2a9-34b6-40a7-aa50-15c2a4cdb390.jpg" alt="Naomi Taniguchi"> <p>Naomi Taniguchi became the first Japanese racer to compete at the world championship level when Honda entered him in the Isle of Man TT. This was the first time for Honda to compete and motorcycle they developed for that race was the RC142 works machine, fitted with an air-cooled, 4-stroke, DOHC, 4-valve, 2-cylinder 125cc engine. Honda fielded a three-rider team for the 1959 TT. In the final, Naomi Taniguchi came in 6th, Giichi Suzuki placed 7th, and Junzo Suzuki finished 11th, with the team taking the Constructor’s Prize. Naomi Taniguchi had finished nearly four minutes behind the rider in front and almost eight minutes down on the race winner, Tarquinio Provini. Honda realised that they had some work to do. For 1960, alongside a team of Japanese riders, Honda decided to recruit experienced privateer Tom Phillis to help them with technical feedback. During the 1960 world championship Tom Phillis qualified second fastest for the Isle of Man 125cc race, but a crash in the 250cc event at Assen saw him replaced by his friend Jim Redman who stunned everyone by lapping two seconds faster than Phillis had managed. The RC143 finished in the points five times, the best results were two fourth places. Honda was third in the constructor championship behind the MV Agusta and MZ.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="77"><!-- react-empty: 78 --></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="79"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="80"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="81"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="82"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="83"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b033207b039ece969d01a2a5c6ddf959/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F701eae7b-c05f-44bf-983b-49cd790eac43.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:96.46464646464646% 91.1070780399274%;" data-reactid="84"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b033207b039ece969d01a2a5c6ddf959/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F701eae7b-c05f-44bf-983b-49cd790eac43.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:96.46464646464646% 91.1070780399274%;" data-reactid="85"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cda86e8cfda844553b80713839063ea8/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F701eae7b-c05f-44bf-983b-49cd790eac43.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:96.46464646464646% 91.1070780399274%;" data-reactid="86"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bccb21982546fa3417353c6df3140e14/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F701eae7b-c05f-44bf-983b-49cd790eac43.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:96.46464646464646% 91.1070780399274%;" data-reactid="87"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="551" data-ratio="1.4373865698729582" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b033207b039ece969d01a2a5c6ddf959/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F701eae7b-c05f-44bf-983b-49cd790eac43.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:96.46464646464646% 91.1070780399274%;" data-reactid="88"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="89"><!-- react-empty: 90 --><!-- react-empty: 91 --><!-- react-empty: 92 --><!-- react-empty: 93 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="94"><!-- react-text: 95 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m #{styles}" data-reactid="96"><p data-reactid="97">Mike Hailwood's Helmet</p></div><!-- react-empty: 98 --><!-- react-empty: 99 --><!-- react-empty: 100 --></div><div class="Paragraph color-text " data-reactid="101"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="102">Right from the start of Mike Hailwood&#x27;s racing career his style of riding was aggressive as you can tell from this shot of his boot worn clean through to his toes and the abrasions on his pudding bowl helmet.</span></div></div></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="103"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="104"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98b3b9e5-0201-436c-a355-b5b4c12ddeb0.jpg" alt="Gene Vincent - Triumph"> <p>The year is 1969 and legendary rock n roller Gene Vincent is in England for a hastily thrown together low budget tour of France and England. 10 years earlier in 1960 a cocky and rebellious Vincent toured England with Eddie Cochran drawing huge crowds. But this was 1969 and the kids were into psychedelic rock now. The previous year in 1968, while touring Germany, Vincent fired four shots from a revolver at Gary Glitter for messing around with his girlfriend (too bad he missed). The very next day a petrified Glitter was on the next available flight back to the UK and when a badly hungover Gene Vincent was woken up the next day he claimed not to remember anything about the night before.</p><p>Gene was hoping 1969 would go smoother, he signed a new record contract with Elektra in Los Angeles, and was to be represented in England by BBC disc jockey John Peel’s Dandelion label. On September 13th 1969 Vincent plays the the Toronto Rock ‘N’ Rock Revival Show. The show was to feature some of the greatest rock stars that had ever lived including Bo Diddley, Junior Walker, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and up-and-coming young stars The Doors and Alice Cooper. There wasn't much interest in the 50's rockers, the Beatles were the biggest band on Earth. So it wasn't till John Lennon who hadn't played a gig in three years was to show up with The Plastic Ono Band (which included Eric Clapton on guitar) that ticket sales sold out. Vincent was backed by Alice Cooper and his band for the show. It was at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival that the Alice Cooper "chicken incident" took place with Alice supposedly biting the chicken's head off before returning it to the crowd.</p><p>That fall Vincent would record the album I'm Back and I'm Proud for John Peel's Dandelion label with a young Linda Ronstadt on backing vocals. The tour of France and England would go poorly with a road-weary Vincent backed by the Wild Angels. Gene was in a great deal of pain from previous injuries. In July 1955 on a Triumph motorcycle Gene crashed shattering his left leg. He refused to have it amputated. The leg was saved, but the crash left him with a limp and chronic pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg for the rest of his life. While on tour with Eddie Cochran in 1960, Gene was involved in a high-speed traffic accident riding in a taxi. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg. Cochran was thrown from the vehicle and suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.</p><p>There is a documentary that was filmed in November of 1969 that follows Vincent on four days of the UK tour filmed by the BBC. The film takes you into a uniquely British world of tiny dance halls and cheap hotels on the Isle of Wight. Gene was flat broke at this point and in the film Gene struggles to get promoters and TV producers to pay him. Less than eighteen months later Gene Vincent died from a burst ulcer in his stomach.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FeSDSand-6IY&amp;h=PAQEEOg_p&amp;enc=AZM-iYB6VKAxmmPSs6GDLTD5OOujViw-_Go0kghlwTXpsZej6zce79K0wINGmWO59NNmoerIx2KrQf8E7Bqe2J7EWWwnANPBEuXW94JDR93n_flKSmkcs0eM9WKNHVpjgTRuHF5_Kjr-65wBZgKsuY0i&amp;s=1">https://youtu.be/eSDSand-6IY</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="105"><!-- react-empty: 106 --></div></section><section id="10" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="107"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="108"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ls-w-33p" data-reactid="109"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="110"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="111"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b28c87ac6695d5e518ba66e5922c86e7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3202aed3-d672-4615-984b-017ffb49a970.jpg&amp;width=751" style="object-position:97.33688415446072% 70.32828282828282%;" data-reactid="112"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b28c87ac6695d5e518ba66e5922c86e7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3202aed3-d672-4615-984b-017ffb49a970.jpg&amp;width=751" style="object-position:97.33688415446072% 70.32828282828282%;" data-reactid="113"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9858cd04a03d6ff6a2e7f39d2da81391/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3202aed3-d672-4615-984b-017ffb49a970.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:97.33688415446072% 70.32828282828282%;" data-reactid="114"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cb02fc15e0b6a8eb8209cbcbfce5bbfe/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3202aed3-d672-4615-984b-017ffb49a970.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:97.33688415446072% 70.32828282828282%;" data-reactid="115"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="751" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.9482323232323232" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b28c87ac6695d5e518ba66e5922c86e7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3202aed3-d672-4615-984b-017ffb49a970.jpg&amp;width=751" style="object-position:97.33688415446072% 70.32828282828282%;" data-reactid="116"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column ls-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ls-p-h-8 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="117"><!-- react-empty: 118 --><!-- react-empty: 119 --><!-- react-empty: 120 --><!-- react-empty: 121 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="122"><!-- react-text: 123 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m #{styles}" data-reactid="124"><p data-reactid="125">Mike Hailwood - Honda</p></div><!-- react-empty: 126 --><!-- react-empty: 127 --><!-- react-empty: 128 --></div><div class="Paragraph color-text ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="129"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="130">Mike Hailwood was a natural who could ride anything. He won GP championships in each of the 250/350/500 classes, including winning in all three classes in the same season, a record five times and winning all three classes in one day, five times! He entered his first race at age 17 placing 11th. The next year in 1958, he won ACU Stars at 125 cc, 250 cc, and 350 cc classes. His father, Stan Hailwood was an ex-racer and a wealthy businessman who owned a successful motorcycle dealership. His father purchased the best equipment for Mike including a four-stroke, four-cylinder 250 cc Honda which he entered the 1961 Isle of Man TT on racing alongside the Honda factory team. he became the first man in the history of the Isle of Man TT to win three races in one week when he won in the 125 cc, 250 cc and 500 cc categories. Mike was leading the 350cc race on an AJS when the gudgeon pin failed dashing his chances. Phil Read won the 350cc solo TT. Phil Read and Giacomo Agostini would become his greatest rivals for most of his career. Hailwood would go on to win the 1961 250cc World Championship on the Honda 4 cylinder.</span></div></div></div></section><section id="12" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="131"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="132"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="133"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="134"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="135"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/598f0db42db44df14f625680c50c256a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F609531e8-5047-4b53-9c3a-e9d75069f743.jpg&amp;width=603" style="object-position:54.31177446102819% 18.876262626262626%;" data-reactid="136"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/598f0db42db44df14f625680c50c256a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F609531e8-5047-4b53-9c3a-e9d75069f743.jpg&amp;width=603" style="object-position:54.31177446102819% 18.876262626262626%;" data-reactid="137"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/598f0db42db44df14f625680c50c256a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F609531e8-5047-4b53-9c3a-e9d75069f743.jpg&amp;width=603" style="object-position:54.31177446102819% 18.876262626262626%;" data-reactid="138"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0a385a7536a0593ab185d4cbeb99d99e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F609531e8-5047-4b53-9c3a-e9d75069f743.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:54.31177446102819% 18.876262626262626%;" data-reactid="139"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="603" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.7613636363636364" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/598f0db42db44df14f625680c50c256a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F609531e8-5047-4b53-9c3a-e9d75069f743.jpg&amp;width=603" style="object-position:54.31177446102819% 18.876262626262626%;" data-reactid="140"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="141"><!-- react-empty: 142 --><!-- react-empty: 143 --><!-- react-empty: 144 --><!-- react-empty: 145 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="146"><!-- react-text: 147 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m #{styles}" data-reactid="148"><p data-reactid="149">Mike Hailwood #28 </p></div><!-- react-empty: 150 --><!-- react-empty: 151 --><!-- react-empty: 152 --></div><div class="Paragraph color-text ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="153"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="154">Mike Hailwood&#x27;s interest in motorcycle racing was so keen that he dropped out of school at sixteen to work on the assembly line at the Triumph factory in Meriden.

By the end of his first full season of club racing, Mike was British Champion. He won his first World Championship in 1961. In 1964 prior to the US Grand Prix in Daytona Stan Hailwood rented the Daytona Speedway and got MV Agusta to lend them a spare 500cc works motorcycle for a go at the world one-hour speed record. Bob McIntyre held the current record of 141 mph (227 km/h), which he set in 1957 on a Gilera 350cc at the extremely bumpy Monza track.

Mussolini had ascended to power and he wanted to leverage GP racing as a political statement like the Germans. Italian motorcycle manufacturers were instructed to produce winning racing machines. Piero Taruffi had achieved great success with the water-cooled Rondines and he came to work for Gilera as part of the deal. Guiseppe Gilera and Taruffi began sorting out the machine's reliability problems by focusing their attention on the crankshaft bearings. The Rondine's handling issues were also resolved with modifications to the frame and tweaks to the blower. The new Gilera four was raced at all the big European racing events. In 1937 in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Giordano Aldrighetti beat the BMW and Moto Guzzi teams to score the Gilera four’s first Grand Prix victory. Piero Taruffi and the Gilera 4 would go on to break fifty world speed records including 170 mph for the flying kilometer.</p><p>Piero Remor one of the original designers of the engine was hired by Guiseppe Gilera in 1940 to work on a next generation engine. Remor designed a supercharged 250cc 4 cylinder that was air-cooled, the engine was built but never raced. WWII of course threw a wrench in things and Italy was crushed. All racing stopped until 1946. After the war superchargers were banned by the F.I.M., the Rondine engine was modified but by now outdated and slow. Taruffi left in 1946 to focus on auto racing so in 1947 Gilera ask Remor to design a new 500cc racer. In the spring of 1948 the new racer was unveiled. It was similar in many ways to the earlier air cooler 250cc and it weighed a mere 270 lbs and produced 48bhp. The new racer was not without problems, rider Nello Pagani described it as ‘unrideable’. The development continued and by the end of 1949 Pagani had two Grand Prix victories. At the end of the 1949 season Piero Remor was disgruntled over compensation and quit Gilera to join MV Agusta. You can imagine how Guiseppe Gilera felt when MV Agusta introduced their 500cc racer in the spring of 1950 and it was a blueprint of the Gilera.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="198"><!-- react-empty: 199 --></div></section><section id="15" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="200"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="201"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7c93a957-af6a-4b23-8628-41a84aa6bde0.jpg" alt="Jack Shemans"> <p>Jack Shemans is a Cycle Cult unsung hero and a highly regarded Triumph and BSA tuning wizard at the Meriden factory and later N.T.V. (Norton Triumph Villers). Jack's father, George Shemans was the chauffeur of Triumph founder Siegfried Bettman and a works team rider. George rose through the ranks of Triumph holding a number of important jobs within the company and enjoying success racing a wide range of events including the Continental Circus, ISDT, endurance runs at Brooklands and even the wooden board tracks of the prewar era. Young Jack Shemans attended trade school landing a job with Daimler upon graduation later working on Whitley and Lancaster bombers at Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. Jack also served with the Naval Bombardment Unit in North Africa. After the war Jack went to work for Triumph eventually moving from the engine production line into the experimental department with Arthur Jakeman and Doug Hele. One of the first racing projects Jack worked on was developing the 500cc T100 for rider Percy Tait. At the Belgian G.P., Percy Tait came in second to Agostini and MV with average speed of 116 m.p.h. There were wins at Daytona In 1966 and 1967 with 500cc engines Jack built and Malcolm Uphill's "Thruxton" 100 m.p.h. production lap. Jack boosted the output of the "Triples" from the original 58 hp to 85 hp. When the Meriden works closed Jack, went to N.V.T. at Kitts Green working on a number of experimental projects including 4-cylinder "Quadrant" engine from two triple engines. Jack joined Norman Hyde after the Kitts Green shop closed. At Norman Hyde he built both road and race engines contributing to the development of many new products. Even after he left Norman Hyde Jack continued building engines in his own shop until retiring.</p><p>ref: <a

Unfortunately injuries and mechanical problems kept him from winning the 500cc crown but he rebounded and won the 1975 500cc title, marking the first time a two-stroke machine won the premier class.

The earlier air cooled design while incredibly fast had serious over heating issues. The new twin overhead cam engine was water cooled with beautiful alloy barrels and cylinder heads cast in pairs, and fitted with enclosed valves. The exhaust ports now exited from the rear on the new design and to further aid cooling an impeller type water pump was added to the left side of the crankshaft. A radiator was mounted on each side of the front frame down tubes and the supercharger boost was reduced to 6 psi. The first outing was to be at the North West 200 piloted by Bob Foster but it flooded and failed to fire on the starting line. Two machines were entered in the 1939 Isle of Man TT, ridden by Walter Rusk and Foster. At 405 lbs they were the heaviest machines entered in the TT. But it was the supercharged BMW's of Georg Meir and Jock West that grabbed the first two places. Rusk and Foster would come in 11th and 13th.</p><p>The last GP race before the outbreak of WWII was Ulster with both the V-4's entered. Foster and Rusk led the race at the start but Foster was forced to retire with a foaled plug in the first lap. Rusk had a 34 second lead at the end of the first lap and a record breaking average speed of 100.03 mph (160.98 km/h). But on his third lap (of 14) Rusk was also forced to retire when linkage on the girder fork broke (that must have been exciting). After the war in June 1946, the AJS V4 finally won, at Chimay in Belgium, ridden by Jock M West, Walter Rusk did not survive the War, and Jock's machine was the bike Rusk had ridden. A week later at Albi, France, Jock West was in the lead when a the crankpin seized and locked. The AJS supercharged "Porcupine" was in development to replace the aging V-4's but just three months after the Albi race, the FIM banned supercharging.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="240"><!-- react-empty: 241 --></div></section><section id="18" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-13vw p-v-4 color-bg  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="242"><span style="font-size:0;" data-reactid="243"></span><div class="Component p-1 color-title color-text " data-reactid="244"><p data-reactid="245">loading ...</p></div></section></div><section id="19" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="246"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="247"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="248"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="249"><span data-reactid="250"><!-- react-empty: 251 --><h2 data-reactid="252"><a data-reactid="253">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="254"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="255"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="256"><div class="Link" data-reactid="257"><a data-reactid="258"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="259"><a data-reactid="260">Cycle Cult RSS</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="261"></div></section></div></div>

The new design had retained the same internal components but the parallel cylinders were now angled upward at a 45 degree angle providing better cooling and a shorter wheelbase.

Motorcycle design just prior to WW2 was advancing at a staggering pace with all kinds of unusual and revolutionary engine layouts being developed. Collier & Sons launched their AJS 500cc V-4 at the Olympia Motor Cycle Show in London in 1935. Designed by Bert Collier, the AJS design was similar to another V-4 Collier engine design, the 1931 593cc Matchless 'Silver Hawk'. The AJS V-4 was technologically advanced 500cc 50º chain-driven SOHC engine, with exposed 'hairpin' valve springs. Although it debuted at the Olympia show as a tourer the machine never went into production and only a few bikes were built. In the spring of 1936 AJS began testing a new racing version of the V-4 at Brooklands. The new machine now had alloy barrels and sported a supercharger designed by Swiss engineer Arnold Zoller. The supercharged V4 produced 55hp and had a top speed of 135mph, it was designed to compete against BMW's Kompressor machines. BMW had been developing supercharged racers for sometime, starting in 1929 with Ernest Henne's 134.6 mph land speed record. The AJS V-4's supercharger was mounted in the front and was driven at half engine speed, and fed by a single Amal TT carburetor. The engine was mounted in the same frame as the 500 cc OHC single TT racers, and used a four-speed Burman gearbox with a dry clutch. Harold Daniell and George Rowley rode the AJS supercharged V4s in the Isle of Man Senior TT, but despite its high top speed, it was heavy, and did not handle well. The bikes were also plagued with carbonation troubles and lacked acceleration. Both riders retired due to mechanical problems. Single cylinder machines would again dominate the TT with Freddie Firth winning on his Norton with a record speed. AJS would continue to develop the V-4 turning to liquid cooling in 1939 utilizing a cast alloy engine with enclosed valve springs. Between 1936 and 1939, the AJS V-4 set several records, breaking the 100 mph lap speed record at the Ulster Grand Prix.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"2905bdcd-416e-41b8-a0c6-cbf95fa2db35","item":"31072782-7d6c-4822-9087-0d14add63b39","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png\" alt=\"George Rowley - AJS V4 Kompressor\"> ","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_caption":"George Rowley - AJS V4 Kompressor","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png","starred":true,"caption":"George Rowley - AJS V4 Kompressor","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2ed849f1f2bc6cae883c0ed6b0587a1f/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2ed849f1f2bc6cae883c0ed6b0587a1f/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2ed849f1f2bc6cae883c0ed6b0587a1f/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3ba351378752442802865cc9c62e08c8/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9ee67c02b40c584ea479a42d423334ec/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F96e1546f-50a2-4bd2-99c8-3ff256a30faf.png&width=360"}],"resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/6e452f0bd662b7625db628d77e653db2.png","ratio":"132:95","aspect":1.3894736842105264,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":570,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"faces":[{"x":157,"y":515,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":4.998347}],"colors":[[0,0,0],[230,220,205],[87,77,63],[132,119,102],[182,170,152]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[87,88],[599,484]],"confidence":0.211257,"center":[338,345],"radius":281.709},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"82728e10-76fc-460e-90ac-d8361d30993f","item":"31072782-7d6c-4822-9087-0d14add63b39","type":"text","html":"<p>This is one of my favorite Isle of Man photos, George Rowley on the AJS V4 Kompressor at the 1936 senior TT.

He entered his first race at age 17 placing 11th. The next year in 1958, he won ACU Stars at 125 cc, 250 cc, and 350 cc classes. His father, Stan Hailwood was an ex-racer and a wealthy businessman who owned a successful motorcycle dealership. His father purchased the best equipment for Mike including a four-stroke, four-cylinder 250 cc Honda which he entered the 1961 Isle of Man TT on racing alongside the Honda factory team. he became the first man in the history of the Isle of Man TT to win three races in one week when he won in the 125 cc, 250 cc and 500 cc categories.

One of the first racing projects Jack worked on was developing the 500cc T100 for rider Percy Tait. At the Belgian G.P., Percy Tait came in second to Agostini and MV with average speed of 116 m.p.h. There were wins at Daytona In 1966 and 1967 with 500cc engines Jack built and Malcolm Uphill's \"Thruxton\" 100 m.p.h. production lap. Jack boosted the output of the \"Triples\" from the original 58 hp to 85 hp. When the Meriden works closed Jack, went to N.V.T. at Kitts Green working on a number of experimental projects including 4-cylinder \"Quadrant\" engine from two triple engines. Jack joined Norman Hyde after the Kitts Green shop closed. At Norman Hyde he built both road and race engines contributing to the development of many new products. Even after he left Norman Hyde Jack continued building engines in his own shop until retiring."},{"id":"be548d37-ca78-4080-8935-7d018c58d02c","item":"579b454b-1c1d-4787-9b2d-bb683710ab78","type":"text","html":"<p>ref: <a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.triples.co.uk%2F&amp;h=DAQHOxr-i&amp;enc=AZM6OQE2xVxTbsbaDLES7gwsf07UCji8HaV4d0m0CIcGcp5kp2gKD1A2bgAu9iCBKGDvCjKZ6qwljpjnghg8NRbdmy1Ok6wE-4n4GvAY52yNXDRCrT7goFmr4a2dDOLCiuO0OABWAhqll43QJh3b0ElA&amp;s=1\">www.triples.co.uk</a></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true},"text":"ref: www.triples.co.uk"},{"id":"c4e3ccd4-2aeb-4293-a49f-313cbfb7a512","item":"579b454b-1c1d-4787-9b2d-bb683710ab78","type":"text","html":"<p>photo: © Jack Shemans</p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true},"text":"photo: © Jack Shemans"}]},"3aafd99e-befc-4e29-984b-987a85695363":{"id":"3aafd99e-befc-4e29-984b-987a85695363","index":14,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-22T13:47:32.905Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T06:47:59.562Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-22-by-1974-even-the-great-giacomo-agostini-couldnt-ignore-the.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"by-1974-even-the-great-giacomo-agostini-couldnt-ignore-the/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"description":"By 1974 even the great Giacomo Agostini couldn't ignore the screaming 2-strokes, he stunned the racing world by announcing that he would leave MV Agusta to ride for Yamaha.
