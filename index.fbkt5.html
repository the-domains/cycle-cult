be badged and raced as a Sunbeam motorcycle. Associated Motor Cycles (AMC) was a British motorcycle manufacturer founded by the Collier brothers as a parent company for the Matchless and AJS motorcycle companies.
    It later absorbed Francis-Barnett, James, Norton and Sunbeam. AMC had big plans for re-launching the Sunbeam marque after the war and wanted leverage GP racing, the E90S model designation for the machine was "E" experimental, "90" a nod to the prewar
    Sunbeam Model 90 works racers and "S" supercharged. Those plans fell through when rival BSA bought Sunbeam in 1943. Joe Craig the engineer best known for Norton's racing singles went to work for AMC briefly in 1939. Craig was tasked with replacing
    the heavy, ill handling supercharged AJS V4's. A near horizontal parallel twin cylinder layout was adopted to reduce weight and allow for positioning of the gear driven Roots type blower above the gearbox for a lower center of gravity and improved
    handling. Just like the last V4's it was also to be water-cooled to handle the heat generated with forced induction. AMC designer Vic Web worked on the project after Craig's departure with the help of Phil Irving. Irving who had previously worked
    for Velocette and Vincent was hired by Joe Craig in 1942. While at Velocette Irving had designed the prototype Model 'O' Velocette, a shaft-drive twin cylinder machine of 600cc capacity and loosely based on the supercharged 500cc racing machine known
    as 'The Roarer'.</p><p>Motorcycle racing in Europe went through a hiatus during most of WWII and when GP racing resumed in 1946 the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) banned forced induction from road racing. The AJS E90S development was halted and hastily converted
    to and air cooled, atmospheric induction design. The cylinders of the new design were inclined 15 degrees, nearly horizontal. It was 68mm by 68.5mm and produced around 40bhp at 7600rpm. It had double overhead cams and overlapping hairpin-type valve
    springs. The main engine castings were of magnesium alloy with the single-piece, forged steel crankshaft that was supported by three bearings. Straight-cut gears drove a unit construction four-speed close-ratio gearbox. The engine was positioned in
    the duplex frame facing forwards and a revised cylinder head with spine-like fins earned it the name "Porcupine". The parallel twin first took to the track in 1947 and was an astonishing engineering achievement. Ted Frend was the first rider to win
    a race on the bike. The bike was not without problems with carburetion being a major issue on a motorcycle designed to be supercharged. At the 1949 Senior TT Les Graham was forced to retire just two minutes from the finish with magneto problems. But
    Graham would bring AJS a victory at the Swiss GP and Ulster, ultimately taking first place in the inaugural Grand Prix World Championships on the Porcupine, a win that was to become AJS' and Graham's only major title.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="39"><!-- react-empty: 40 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-14c288a4-03e7-4e86-b55b-f1eb06d36523" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="41"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="42"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/27321f69-6860-45ab-99b4-e220eb92f51e.jpg" alt="Tom Phillis - Norton"><p>Tom Phillis' first motorcycle was a 1939 High Cam Sunbeam B25 that he bought while working as an apprentice mechanic in Sydney. Phillis began racing a Velocette MAC in Junior Clubman events around 1953. In 1955 his wife Betty helped him buy a BSA Gold
    Star and he started to get serious about racing. His next machine was this two year old Manx Norton that he is standing next to in this photo taken at Fishermans Bend, an old airfield circuit in Melbourne. Phillis won the 350cc class and finished
    third in the 500cc class, equalling the lap record. In 1958, Phillis and his wife sold everything and went to Europe, where they bought new 350cc and 500cc Manx Nortons. At Thruxton Phillis won the 350 and the 500 events and set a new 500cc lap record.
    He repeated this "double" at the Falkenberg circuit in Sweden, and was now regarded as one of the top privateers in Europe. In 1959, he entered the Isle of Man and took fifth in the 350cc Formula 1 but broke a con-rod in the last lap of the Junior
    TT. High winds and torrential rain made the Senior TT challenging and Tom finished in sixteenth place. Phillis was impressed with Honda's debut effort at the TT which resulted in Honda claiming 6th, 7th, 8th and 11th in the 125cc light weight class,
    as well as the Manufacturers' Team Award. In 1960 Phillis wrote a personal letter to Soichiro Honda and Soichiro responded by making Phillis a Honda works rider in February 1960. Another Aussie, Bob Brown was also sign to the team and Honda returned
    to the Isle of Man for 1960 with revised 125 twins and 16-valve 250 fours. Tom Phillis qualified second fastest for the Isle of Man 125cc race and ended the race in 10th place. Over all Honda did well at the 1960 TT with their riders taking the 6th
    through 10th positions in the 125 race and 4th through 6th places in the 250cc category. Bob Brown's 4th in the 250 TT made him the first Westerner to score world championship points on a Japanese machine. Phillis would bring Honda it's first world
    championship race victory at Montjuich Parc, Barcelona on April 23, 1961 and Honda’s first GP double at Clermont-Ferrand, France on May 21.</p><p>Photo credit: Charles Rice</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-304146cb-3d26-43c0-883e-b34ee1ecd1bb" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="46"><picture>

</picture><p>Ángel Nieto is one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time that you may never have heard of unless you are Spanish then of course you know him as a motorcycle God. Barry Sheene considered him among the greatest motorcycle racers of all time.
    An incredible 13 world championship titles in 50cc and 125cc with 90 GP victories, he finished on the podium 500 times! He was also runner-up four times, twenty times champion of Spain in the various displacements of 50, 80, 125 and 250 cc, and five-time
    runner-up Spain. Nieto moved to Barcelona from Madrid as a young man and found a job at the Derbi motorcycle factory. He began his racing career in 1968 winning his first two amateur races. In 1969, he entered six races and was on the podium six times
    including two first, and three second place finishes giving him his first 50cc world title. Though he was never successful at the world level racing in the larger displacements, he won Spanish National Championships in the 50 cc, 125 cc, 250 cc, 500
    cc and 750 cc classes. His total of 90 Grand Prix victories is third only to the 122 by Giacomo Agostini, and the 110 of Valentino Rossi.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="47"><!-- react-empty: 48 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-e5340c8c-05bd-49ce-9080-fbdf21fe9a1d" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="49"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="50"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/075fa201-e381-48d0-8952-7352c6d48dec.jpg" alt="Pierce-Arrow "><p>The Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company made one of the finest pre-war era luxury automobiles but the company started by George N. Pierce also manufactured some innovative motorcycles and bicycles. The first Pierce bicycle appeared in 1890 and they started
    manufacturing automobiles in 1901. In 1906 the Pierce Cycle Company led by George N. Pierce's son, Percy would become a separate enterprise. Percy Pierce acquired a Belgian FN Four cylinder motorcycle in 1908 and brought it to America to disassemble
    and study. The FN Four's engine was designed by Paul Kelecom who had designed single cylinder engines prior to the FN. Using the FN as "reference" the Pierce design department spent the next two years developing the innovative Pierce Four. Large diameter
    tubing was used and the engine became a stressed member of the frame construction. The frame also held oil and gasoline internally and concealed the control cables. The Pierce Four had a T-head, and cam-driven intake valves and was shaft driven. By
    1910 a two-speed transmission was offered and the company also offered a single cylinder model which was belt driven. Pierce bicycles had since 1900 offered a chainless shaft drive system and other innovations like the Cushion Frame launched in 1898
    which featured a shock absorber on the post connecting the rear axle to the seat pillar and sprung forks in 1903. The Pierce Bicycles were endorsed by 16 time national bicycle champion Frank Kramer. The company slogan "Tried &amp; True" appeared on
    all their advertising material. The Pierce Four motorcycle is said to have cost more to build than its sale price and eventually bankrupted Pierce Motorcycle Company after fewer than 500 were built. The last Pierce Motorcycle was produced in 1914,
    bicycles would remain in production at the original Buffalo, NY factory until 1918. That same year the Emblem Manufacturing Company in Angola, NY purchased the bicycle business and would continue to manufacture a Pierce bicycle line until 1940. The
    Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company went under in 1938. This photo is of H. L. Wilkens &amp; Co.'s Pierce dealership at 1082 Bedford avenue in Brooklyn NY.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --></div></section><section id="section-v_Graphical-5d59db73-993b-4142-a847-bb9002961bf7" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="53"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--graphical max-w-768px p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="55"><a class=" " href="cycle-cult-chopper-girl" data-reactid="56"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="57"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="58"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/84e0f8d486f9e0e8a9d78810552a9216/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3fe77734-5b80-456a-bee7-3fac477af158.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:42.36111111111111% 12.594696969696969%;" data-reactid="59"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/84e0f8d486f9e0e8a9d78810552a9216/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3fe77734-5b80-456a-bee7-3fac477af158.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:42.36111111111111% 12.594696969696969%;" data-reactid="60"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c6a451bcbb7b7ae2dc12e52dc5609c19/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3fe77734-5b80-456a-bee7-3fac477af158.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:42.36111111111111% 12.594696969696969%;" data-reactid="61"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0319d7692d8df8a28434bae8f897119b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3fe77734-5b80-456a-bee7-3fac477af158.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:42.36111111111111% 12.594696969696969%;" data-reactid="62"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="528" data-ratio="1.5" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/84e0f8d486f9e0e8a9d78810552a9216/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3fe77734-5b80-456a-bee7-3fac477af158.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:42.36111111111111% 12.594696969696969%;" data-reactid="63"/></picture></div></a><!-- react-empty: 64 --><!-- react-empty: 65 --><div class="max-w-560px m-t-1 m-a" data-reactid="66"><!-- react-text: 67 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="68"><p data-reactid="69">Cycle Cult Chopper Girl</p></div><a class=" " href="cycle-cult-chopper-girl" data-reactid="70"><!-- react-empty: 71 --></a><!-- react-empty: 72 --><!-- react-empty: 73 --></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-8b9d9a66-3326-47e1-9344-beda851aa9ae" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="74"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="75"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/043bad21-4a3f-437a-bc60-4e79e1490947.jpg" alt="Silvio Grassetti"><p>The Benelli 250cc four cylinder GP bike made its racing debut in 1962. Silvio Grassetti made his Grand Prix debut as a Benelli factory rider in 1959 and is photographed here in 1962 with the Benelli 250/4 which he rode in several Italian competitions
    while the bike was still under development. It had a dry sump engine with vertical cylinders and double-overhead camshafts with two valves per cylinder. The prototype weighted just 268lbs dry and produced 40bhp at 13,000rpm! Tarquinio Provini joined
    the Benelli works team in 1964 and brought Benelli it's first victory with the 250/4 at the Spanish Montjuic circuit, his first race with the team. Provini placed fifth in the 1964 the world cup. In 1965 riding a 350cc (a bored out 250cc/4), Provini
    won the Grand Prix of Italy at Monza. 1966 was looking good for Benelli until tragically, Provini suffered a serious crash at the Isle of Man TT in practice that broke his back in 5 places. Tarquinio Provini had 20 GP victories between 1954 and ’65,
    six in 125 and 14 in 250, as well as 13 Italian championships and four Isle of Man TTs. Benelli hired Aermacchi rider Renzo Pasolini for 1967. In 1968 Pasolini won the Italian title and came in second at the TT on the 250/4. At the start of the 1969
    season Pasolini crashed at Hockenheim and missed 2 GP races and the IOM TT. Kel Carruthers and Phil Read were enlisted by Benelli to race the TT and Carruthers won the TT. Carruthers became a Benelli works rider and Pasolini returned winning the Dutch
    GP on the 250/4. The FIM changed the rules in 1970 limiting the 250 class to two cylinders and six gears making the 250/4 obsolete.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="76"><!-- react-empty: 77 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-2004bf7c-90a1-480c-8e3a-7dc51b5ed5ea" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="78"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="79"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="80"><a class=" " href="ok-cycle-cultists-here-is-a-puzzler-what-is-this-engine-a" data-reactid="81"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="82"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="83"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f531ff90ba1c77f5b94839116019b49d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4583f4d9-fac4-4890-bfc9-45f8a14c4f02.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:97.85353535353535% 46.54178674351585%;" data-reactid="84"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f531ff90ba1c77f5b94839116019b49d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4583f4d9-fac4-4890-bfc9-45f8a14c4f02.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:97.85353535353535% 46.54178674351585%;" data-reactid="85"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b14ab9aec3fd71b58c9f8c8311181a47/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4583f4d9-fac4-4890-bfc9-45f8a14c4f02.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:97.85353535353535% 46.54178674351585%;" data-reactid="86"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e7ff6a626e8d6cddcfe93b8b1d9fcd2e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4583f4d9-fac4-4890-bfc9-45f8a14c4f02.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:97.85353535353535% 46.54178674351585%;" data-reactid="87"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="694" data-ratio="1.1412103746397695" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f531ff90ba1c77f5b94839116019b49d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4583f4d9-fac4-4890-bfc9-45f8a14c4f02.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:97.85353535353535% 46.54178674351585%;" data-reactid="88"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="89"><!-- react-empty: 90 --><!-- react-empty: 91 --><!-- react-empty: 92 --><!-- react-empty: 93 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="94"><!-- react-text: 95 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="96"><p data-reactid="97">Vostok GP Engine</p></div><a class=" " href="ok-cycle-cultists-here-is-a-puzzler-what-is-this-engine-a" data-reactid="98"><!-- react-empty: 99 --></a><!-- react-empty: 100 --><!-- react-empty: 101 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="102"><p>Ok, Cycle Cultist's here is a puzzler.

</picture><p>Ultra-lightweight motorcycles have always piqued my interest and the Motom marque crafted a handsome machine. A lot of engineers in post WWII Italy were looking to design exceptionally fuel efficient transportation. Battista Falchetto an ex Lancia engineer,
    introduced his first little motorbike at the Geneva Motor Show in 1947. The Motomic or Atomic Moto had an innovative lightweight pressed sheet metal frame sporting a 50cc single-cylinder 4-stroke engine, with incredible performance and low fuel consumption.
    The Motom was an instant success and Falchetto began designing more small machines for the market. In 1950, the Motom Dolphin was introduced with a 147cc single cylinder engine that was tilted forward with over head valves and a four-speed transmission.
    In 1953, a third model, the Motion Touring 98 was introduced with a frame formed by a central truss presses sheet metal that incorporated the gas tank. Many unique designs would follow, Motom manufactured motorcycles and mopeds in Milano, Italy, from
    1945 to 1971. The little racer pictured here was a 1962 prototype with a horizontal cylinder layout and a sweet 98cc OHC four stroke 2-valve unit construction engine.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="106"><!-- react-empty: 107 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-737e019a-3a36-4963-9fb3-26224b16d406" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="108"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="109"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ms-w-66p" data-reactid="110"><a class=" " href="this-is-what-a-pit-stop-during-the-french-motorcycle-grand-p" data-reactid="111"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="112"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="113"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/37c5394df0c97530c84dd45e34bdddee/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1beee23c-eef3-4278-8575-c664704ab943.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:48.61111111111111% 23.583180987202926%;" data-reactid="114"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/37c5394df0c97530c84dd45e34bdddee/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1beee23c-eef3-4278-8575-c664704ab943.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:48.61111111111111% 23.583180987202926%;" data-reactid="115"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3c1608aa253b449fd82b6052e3230d67/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1beee23c-eef3-4278-8575-c664704ab943.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:48.61111111111111% 23.583180987202926%;" data-reactid="116"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9212229e5575f60449a7964e0392ace4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1beee23c-eef3-4278-8575-c664704ab943.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:48.61111111111111% 23.583180987202926%;" data-reactid="117"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="547" data-ratio="1.4478976234003655" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/37c5394df0c97530c84dd45e34bdddee/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1beee23c-eef3-4278-8575-c664704ab943.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:48.61111111111111% 23.583180987202926%;" data-reactid="118"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-h-5 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="119"><!-- react-empty: 120 --><!-- react-empty: 121 --><!-- react-empty: 122 --><!-- react-empty: 123 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="124"><!-- react-text: 125 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="126"><p data-reactid="127">Paul Meunier </p></div><a class=" " href="this-is-what-a-pit-stop-during-the-french-motorcycle-grand-p" data-reactid="128"><!-- react-empty: 129 --></a><!-- react-empty: 130 --><!-- react-empty: 131 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="132"><p>This is what a pit stop during the French Motorcycle Grand Prix looked like in the 20's.

Australian racers Tom Phillis and Bob Brown were added to the Honda works team to help them with technical feedback in February of 1960. In 1959 with two previous
    years experience racing the Continental Circus, Phillis a privateer had won three international 500cc victories on his Norton. Bob Brown had finished in third place in both the 350cc and 500cc world championships. Honda returned to the Isle of Man
    in 1960 with revised 125 twins (RC143) and 16-valve (RC161) 250 fours. Phillis' machine suffered from misfiring during the 250 TT, but Brown finished fourth, becoming the first Westerner to score world championship points on a Japanese machine. Brown's
    average speed of 89.21mph was a good 4mph behind race winner Carlo Ubbiali's MV Agusta on the 37 3/4 mile mountain course. Luigi Taveri (shown here) became frustrated with MV Agusta, where Ubbiali was the favored 125/250 rider and planned to retire
    from racing at the end of 1960. But his wife Tilde approached Honda on his behalf and he became a Honda works rider in 1961.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="135"><!-- react-empty: 136 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-7995d152-cf13-466f-81e8-a108993eca0e" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="137"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="138"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3d3a4bba-28f6-4ba2-bb69-750fd142f4ee.jpg" alt="Ernest Henry"><p>In 1914 the French automobile company Peugeot developed the most technically advanced motorcycle engine to date, the first twin-cylinder double overhead cam engine with 4 valves per cylinder. The engineer responsible for this remarkable achievement was
    Ernest Henry and he was just 27 years old at the time he joined Peugeot in 1911. Henry had previously studied at the Applied Mechanics Technical in Geneva later working on marine and aviation engines for Picker of Geneva and Motos Labor Manufacturing
    in Paris. Peugeot was already a major player in auto racing with drivers Georges Billet, Paul Zuccarelli, and Jules Goux driving for the factory team. These men convinced Robert Peugeot that an engine with optimized engine airflow utilizing twin cams
    and more valves could create impressive power. Peugeot embraced their theories and tasked young Ernest Henry with developing the new engine with input from the drivers. The old guard technical staff at Peugeot considered the project a foolish pursuit
    and began to call the team "Les Charlatans". Henry started from a blank page in the racing department, working in secret with a budget allocated by the factory. In early 1912 the design was completed and featured four inclined valves for each of the
    four cylinders with a twin camshaft cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers. The 4 valves per cylinder were arranged in V, with 7.6 liter (L76 type) and 3 liter (3 type) restricted capacity engines being built. The new lighter car could
    reach 120mph and won the 1912 French Grand Prix in both the unlimited and the three-liter restricted Coupe de l'Auto competition. In 1914 Henry designed a 500cc parallel-twin engine for the Peugeot 500 M racing motorcycle, using two 250cc cylinders
    from his auto engine design. It had a double overhead cam head, actuated by a cascade of gears and 4 valves per cylinder. The engine was very sophisticated for the time, however the head suffered from over heating issues attributed to the limited
    performance of metallurgy of the era, causing the cylinder heads to warp from excessive heat between the valve sockets. In 1919 Marcel Grémillon did a major re-design of the engine. Henry's original design had exposed valve train gear drive mechanism
    between the two cylinders, later versions like the one shown moved the drive to the side of the cylinders. After WWI in 1923, Lessman Antonesco revised the design with a single camshaft and two valves per cylinder, dry clutch, kick start, three-speed
    transmission and front brakes, it produced a claimed 27 hp.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="139"><!-- react-empty: 140 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-21ef852f-14cb-467d-8d49-6212beb2a4c8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="141"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="142"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05b78ecc-5b73-4280-a501-2f7f4e7adc63.jpg" alt="Flying Freddie Dixon"><p>This is a great shot of "Flying Freddie" Dixon prior to the race at Circuit de la Sartre in Le Mans, France on 7/22/1921. In the 1920s, the course was unpaved and drove from the frighteningly narrow pits on Rue de Laigné straight into the city, and took
    a tight hairpin right-hander near the river Sartre Pontlieue bridge, left the city again on the rather straight street now named Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder. Freddie's solo Douglas looks to be the 4 HP model with front and rear
    brakes. After WWI, Dixon went into business for himself at Park Garage on Linthorpe Road, Middlesbrough and competed in motorcycle races in various categories through out the 20's. He worked closely with Douglas in their Design and Racing Departments
    especially after his victory in the 1923 Isle of Man TT Motorcycle and Sidecar event. Freddie’s first solo TT win came in 1927 on a HRD machine. He retired from motorcycle racing in 1928 and left Douglas in 1930. After leaving Douglas, Freddie began
    to design and market a water-cooled 4 cylinder motorcycle but the Depression put an end to that venture. In 1932 Freddie began automotive racing with his own specially prepared Riley cars. He won the British Racing Driver Club 500 Mile Race at Brooklands
    in 1934 and 1936. he was the only man to lap Brooklands at 130mph in a car of less than 2 liters. In 1935 and 1936 he won the RAC TT car races held at the Ards circuit in Northern Ireland with his Riley. He is the only driver ever to have won TT races
    on two, three and four wheels, a record that still stands today. In 1938 Brough Superior based their 996 cc Four cylinder (doubly opposed) OHV, ‘Golden Dream’ on Freddie and 'Ike' Hatch's designs but production was stopped by the outbreak of WWII
    in 1939. In 1948 he was contacted by the Douglas motorcycle company to help in the development of their T35 motorcycle which was one of the first real new British post war designs, he redesigned the top half of the engine and these modifications resulted
    in the new Mark 3 Douglas machine. Dixon died on the 5th of November 1956 in Reigate, Surrey at age 64.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="143"><!-- react-empty: 144 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-c04c8cd8-9c98-4867-8cda-2dd80c9aa126" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="145"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="146"><picture>

</picture><p>The Honda RC142 1959-1960, had a capacity of 124.6cc and a bore and stroke of 44x41mm with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. The engine developed 18.5bhp at 13000rpm and a weight of 87kg. Soichiro Honda wanted to compete in the Isle of Man TT races and by
    1954 he had developed a single cylinder prototype race bike. He attended the TT as a spectator that year and realised that the competition was tougher than expected and his prototype wasn't up to the job so he went shopping. While in europe he bought
    all kinds of racing components and stuffed his suitcases with what he had aquired. With careful examination of these components and a couple years of new development on completely redesigned over head cam twin cylinder machines he was finally ready
    to take on the world and entered his RC142 machines in the 1959 Isle of Man TT. The twin cylinder engines were four stroke with the cylinders inclined forward 6 degrees with a DOHC, driven by a vertical shaft with bevel gears. During practice for
    the TT it was obvious that the engines were under powered so four-valve heads which had been in development back in Japan were flown in prior to the race. But while reliable, on the TT course the bike still weren't fast enough to beat the european
    competition.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="147"><!-- react-empty: 148 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-20a44f5c-703a-482d-b811-76d9b6ac20d4" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="149"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="150"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/71573ece-24a2-4ed8-a75f-292921436dec.jpg" alt="Alec Bennett"><p>Alec Bennett won the 500cc Senior French Grand Prix in 1921 at Le Mans and the 1922 French GP at Strasbourg (photo) on his Sunbeam TT. Sunbeam achieved its first T.T. victory when Tommy de la Hay came first in the Senior Race at an average speed of 51.79
    m.p.h. In 1921, George Dance made a series of superb runs on Sunbeams at Brooklands. In the 350 c.c. class he set a new record at 82.25 m.p.h. in the Flying Kilometer, and achieved 82.19 m.p.h. in the Flying Mile. In the 500 c.c. class he achieved
    93.99 m.p.h. in the Flying Kilometer, 87.35 m.p.h. in the Flying 5 Miles and 82.69 m.p.h. in the Standing 10 miles. Sunbeam achieved its second T.T. win in 1922 when Alec Bennett came in first in the 500cc Senior. Bennett's win at the TT created problems
    at Sunbeam because the win led to a disagreement between Alec and Tommy de la Hay. Both men wanted to be regarded as the leading Sunbeam rider. Sunbeam boss, Sidney Bowers intervened and chose Tommy, and Alec Bennett left Sunbeam to work for Douglas.
    He didn't ride for Sunbeam again until 1929. Alec Bennett had five career wins at the Isle of Man TT races starting in 1922 on a Sunbeam, 1924 Senior 500cc Norton, 1926 Junior 350cc Velocette Ktt, 1927 Senior 500cc Norton CS1 and the 1928 Junior 350cc
    Norton. After racing with the works Norton team and also with the factory Sunbeam and Velocette teams, Bennett retired from motorcycle racing in the 1930s to concentrate on his retail motor-trade business in Southampton, Hampshire.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="151"><!-- react-empty: 152 --></div></section><section id="section-InfiniteScroll-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="153"><span style="font-size:0;" data-reactid="154"></span><div class="Component p-1 color-title color-text " data-reactid="155"><p data-reactid="156">loading ...</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="157"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="158"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="159"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="160"><span data-reactid="161"><!-- react-empty: 162 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="163"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="164">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="165"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="166"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="167"><div class="Link" data-reactid="168"><a data-reactid="169"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="170"><a data-reactid="171"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

AJS \"Porcupine\" was originally to be badged and raced as a Sunbeam motorcycle. Associated Motor Cycles (AMC) was a British motorcycle manufacturer founded by the Collier brothers as a parent company for the Matchless and AJS motorcycle companies. It later absorbed Francis-Barnett, James, Norton and Sunbeam. AMC had big plans for re-launching the Sunbeam marque after the war and wanted leverage GP racing, the E90S model designation for the machine was \"E\" experimental, \"90\" a nod to the prewar Sunbeam Model 90 works racers and \"S\" supercharged. Those plans fell through when rival BSA bought Sunbeam in 1943. Joe Craig the engineer best known for Norton's racing singles went to work for AMC briefly in 1939. Craig was tasked with replacing the heavy, ill handling supercharged AJS V4's. A near horizontal parallel twin cylinder layout was adopted to reduce weight and allow for positioning of the gear driven Roots type blower above the gearbox for a lower center of gravity and improved handling.

Barry Sheene considered him among the greatest motorcycle racers of all time. An incredible 13 world championship titles in 50cc and 125cc with 90 GP victories, he finished on the podium 500 times! He was also runner-up four times, twenty times champion of Spain in the various displacements of 50, 80, 125 and 250 cc, and five-time runner-up Spain. Nieto moved to Barcelona from Madrid as a young man and found a job at the Derbi motorcycle factory. He began his racing career in 1968 winning his first two amateur races.

The Motomic or Atomic Moto had an innovative lightweight pressed sheet metal frame sporting a 50cc single-cylinder 4-stroke engine, with incredible performance and low fuel consumption. The Motom was an instant success and Falchetto began designing more small machines for the market. In 1950, the Motom Dolphin was introduced with a 147cc single cylinder engine that was tilted forward with over head valves and a four-speed transmission. In 1953, a third model, the Motion Touring 98 was introduced with a frame formed by a central truss presses sheet metal that incorporated the gas tank. Many unique designs would follow, Motom manufactured motorcycles and mopeds in Milano, Italy, from 1945 to 1971. The little racer pictured here was a 1962 prototype with a horizontal cylinder layout and a sweet 98cc OHC four stroke 2-valve unit construction engine.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"35e8ecaf-ee90-4e40-b41a-8719d22165ce","item":"4f94b6a6-b0fb-4aab-8c7e-2c61220df855","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e1be3bd7561b27fbab132f4f681ce3f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e1be3bd7561b27fbab132f4f681ce3f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/13935b67d7f0ade9d414482674815eef/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d116fafbda4eec894a2c8aa6b32b9f08/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e1be3bd7561b27fbab132f4f681ce3f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=792\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e1be3bd7561b27fbab132f4f681ce3f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/303a615d74d2d3a8ef3cd2c5a4b6e89f.png","ratio":"4:3","aspect":1.3333333333333333,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":594,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e1be3bd7561b27fbab132f4f681ce3f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e1be3bd7561b27fbab132f4f681ce3f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/13935b67d7f0ade9d414482674815eef/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d116fafbda4eec894a2c8aa6b32b9f08/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee45e93-80d9-488e-a0d8-082cab99e69a.jpg&width=360"}],"faces":[{"x":725,"y":534,"width":30,"height":30,"confidence":5.003873},{"x":667,"y":559,"width":30,"height":30,"confidence":4.999862}],"colors":[[226,213,197],[0,0,0],[163,150,131],[107,94,77],[77,64,48]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[47,102],[754,487]],"confidence":0.501618,"center":[486,257],"radius":288.454},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"6616a484-bda2-498f-b16c-b23c68cd0320","item":"4f94b6a6-b0fb-4aab-8c7e-2c61220df855","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Ultra-lightweight motorcycles have always piqued my interest and the Motom marque crafted a handsome machine.

The engine developed 18.5bhp at 13000rpm and a weight of 87kg. Soichiro Honda wanted to compete in the Isle of Man TT races and by 1954 he had developed a single cylinder prototype race bike. He attended the TT as a spectator that year and realised that the competition was tougher than expected and his prototype wasn't up to the job so he went shopping. While in europe he bought all kinds of racing components and stuffed his suitcases with what he had aquired. With careful examination of these components and a couple years of new development on completely redesigned over head cam twin cylinder machines he was finally ready to take on the world and entered his RC142 machines in the 1959 Isle of Man TT. The twin cylinder engines were four stroke with the cylinders inclined forward 6 degrees with a DOHC, driven by a vertical shaft with bevel gears. During practice for the TT it was obvious that the engines were under powered so four-valve heads which had been in development back in Japan were flown in prior to the race.
