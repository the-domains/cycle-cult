            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>\</h1><p>Alistair King on a Norton Manx, focused and determined at the North West 200 in 1958. King won the 1958 350cc race at "the Triangle", a road course in Northern Ireland. The North West 200 was originally run over a distance of 200 miles on public roads in the North West of Ireland, it was moved to the north coast but the name was never changed. The course is still a street circuit, made up of public roads running between the towns of Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush (the Triangle) is one of the fastest in the world, with speeds in excess of 200 mph (320 km/h). Alistair King began racing in 1953, in the Club Mans Senior TT on a Norton. The Club Mans race class was intended for amateurs and was established in 1947 by the Auto-Cycle Union, Alistair came in fifth at his first TT race. By 1957 King was entered in the "professional" Senior TT and came in seventh. In 1958 on his Norton Manx he earned his first World Championship point placing sixth in the Senior TT. In 1959 Alistair King won the newly established 350 Formula One TT , which was open for production racers , but more important was his second in the Senior TT and third place in the Junior TT. He was also sixth in the 500cc class at the Ulster GP and he again won the 350cc North West 200. 1961 was his best year. In the Isle of Man TT he took fourth place in the Senior TT, and at Ulster he was second in the 350 cc class with Bianchi and third in the 500cc class with Norton. In the 500cc race in Monza he finished second. He thus finished fifth in the standings of the 500cc World Championship.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/282ce012-b0b8-4db2-960d-e8c3d0b2284e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
