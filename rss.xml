            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>the Dunwoody Collection ( Bob Dunwoody)</h1><p>Alistair King on a Norton Manx, focused and determined at the North West 200 in 1958. King won the 1958 350cc race at "the Triangle", a road course in Northern Ireland. The North West 200 was originally run over a distance of 200 miles on public roads in the North West of Ireland, it was moved to the north coast but the name was never changed. The course is still a street circuit, made up of public roads running between the towns of Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush (the Triangle) is one of the fastest in the world, with speeds in excess of 200 mph (320 km/h). Alistair King began racing in 1953, in the Club Mans Senior TT on a Norton. The Club Mans race class was intended for amateurs and was established in 1947 by the Auto-Cycle Union, Alistair came in fifth at his first TT race. By 1957 King was entered in the "professional" Senior TT and came in seventh. In 1958 on his Norton Manx he earned his first World Championship point placing sixth in the Senior TT. In 1959 Alistair King won the newly established 350 Formula One TT , which was open for production racers , but more important was his second in the Senior TT and third place in the Junior TT. He was also sixth in the 500cc class at the Ulster GP and he again won the 350cc North West 200. 1961 was his best year. In the Isle of Man TT he took fourth place in the Senior TT, and at Ulster he was second in the 350 cc class with Bianchi and third in the 500cc class with Norton. In the 500cc race in Monza he finished second. He thus finished fifth in the standings of the 500cc World Championship.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/282ce012-b0b8-4db2-960d-e8c3d0b2284e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Photo: the Dunwoody Collection ( Bob Dunwoody)</h1><p>Terry Hill shown here talking to Sammy Miller at the 1957 Ulster Grand Prix was the owner of an NSU dealership in Northern Ireland. In 1956 Terry had acquired a 250 NSU Sportmax racer from the racing department in Germany and offered Sammy his first works ride. In his first race with the Sportmax, the North West 200, Sammy broke the track record on the machine and won the 250cc, not a bad debut with a new ride. In 1957 he won the 250cc North West 200 again with the NSU. In the 125cc Ultra-Lightweight TT he was fourth with a Mondial and in the 250cc Lightweight TT fifth, also with and Mondial. In the 1957 World Cup , he was third in the 250cc class. He won the 1958 250cc North West 200 again with the NSU and in the Ultra-Lightweight TT he came in fourth on a Ducati and in the Lightweight TT took fifth with a CZ . In 1958 he also began focusing his efforts on Trials competitions, eventually winning eleven British titles in the sport. He also won nine gold medals in the International Six Days Trial (ISDT) and he was European champion twice! Since 1964 Sammy and his wife Rosemary have operated the Sammy Miller motor museum in New Milton. There are over 300 motorcycles on display many of which are original works machines and prototypes. Included in the collection are an original sterile AJS E90 Porcupine, Geoff Duke's Gilera 500 4C and a Verdel with a radial engine. Sammy Miller was one of the best trial riders of all time.Photo: the Dunwoody Collection ( Bob Dunwoody)</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cbaaa7c1-7145-4e45-803b-6b1ee6c3d605.jpg"></article>]]></description>
