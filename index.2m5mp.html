The sloping stressed member concept was patented in 1900 by Joah ("John") Carver Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner. After Harry Rayner died in a car accident, Joah went into partnership with Richard Moore and P&amp;M motorcycles was established. I've always admired the large heavyweight sloping 40-degree, "Panther" single-cylinderengine's masculine appearance. The first Panther was launched in 1924 and was promoted as "The Perfected Motorcycle". You often see Panthers attached to sidecars, a task they are well suited for thanks to its large flywheels and high torque output. The 1935 Model 100 was the machine on which Miss Florence Blenkiron and Miss Teresa Wallach undertook the epic journey from London to Cape Town, crossing the Sahara. The 1933 Model 100 had a Sturmey-Archer 4-speed, hand-change gearbox, in 1934 a Burman 4-speed foot-change gearbox was introduced. This amazing technical illustration was done by Francis Alexander Simpson for "The Motor Cycle" where he worked from 1917 to 1932 when he left and began a freelance illustration career.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="15"><!-- react-empty: 16 --></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="19"><a class="" data-reactid="20"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="21"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="22"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc915d834e48700cb4a630c4a0855082/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F63015709-1c55-4b52-b15f-ced48d2508c3.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:90.84595959595958% 18.954918032786885%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc915d834e48700cb4a630c4a0855082/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F63015709-1c55-4b52-b15f-ced48d2508c3.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:90.84595959595958% 18.954918032786885%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2bb554f6bfe78284ee3bc6d169cea40e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F63015709-1c55-4b52-b15f-ced48d2508c3.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:90.84595959595958% 18.954918032786885%;" data-reactid="25"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/57538b3b972df7bde8f9dbe05ec2084e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F63015709-1c55-4b52-b15f-ced48d2508c3.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:90.84595959595958% 18.954918032786885%;" data-reactid="26"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="488" data-ratio="1.6229508196721312" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc915d834e48700cb4a630c4a0855082/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F63015709-1c55-4b52-b15f-ced48d2508c3.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:90.84595959595958% 18.954918032786885%;" data-reactid="27"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><!-- react-empty: 32 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="33"><!-- react-text: 34 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="35"><p data-reactid="36">Phelon & Moore - Panther Engine</p></div><!-- react-empty: 37 --><!-- react-empty: 38 --><!-- react-empty: 39 --></div><div class="Paragraph b { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;a98c2d62-edda-4d23-b7fe-77104b0dd2d6&quot;, &quot;item&quot;: &quot;7618100b-bb3f-47a1-bd4c-b932d2a12559&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;src&quot;: null, &quot;created_at&quot;: null, &quot;updated_at&quot;: null, &quot;ctaType&quot;: undefined, &quot;_title&quot;: undefined, &quot;_caption&quot;: undefined, &quot;_text&quot;: &quot;This photo of a Panther engine was taken in the Phelon &amp; Moore factory at Cleckheaton, Yorkshire, England.

<p>The Brooklands race track in Weybridge, Surrey opened in 1907 and is often called the 'birth place of British motor-sport'. A railway engineer designed the banked curves to allow speeds up to 90mph but by the 1930's racers were reaching speeds well over 130mph. It was 100ft wide and the length was three and a quarter miles, of which two miles were level. The banking on one end was 25ft 8" inches high and the opposite end was 28ft 8" inches high. The surface was built of gravel and Portland concrete, not the new and prohibitively expensive asphalt and as such was very bumpy. More than a 1,000 men were involved in the construction financed by Hugh and Ethel Locke King. The Brooklands Automobile Racing Club (BARC) was formed in December 1906 a month before the track was completed. By January of 1907 Hugh Locke King has a nervous breakdown and was close to bankruptcy from cost over runs, Ethel took over control and was able to raise more funds from family and friends. Prior to a race groups of workers with ropes tied around their waists to keep them from falling down the steep banking, would sweep the surface with brooms by hand. On June 29th 1907 Selwyn Edge established a 24 hour solo record traveling 1,500 miles at an average speed of 65mph with a few brief rests in between. The constant noise created by the record event annoyed the neighbors so much that no more 24 hour attempts were allowed, unless completed in two 12 hour daylight stints, which would become known as the 'Double 12'.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="46"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/186a5265-e767-4a68-bf96-46babf4729cd.jpg" alt="Gwenda Jason - Brooklands 1922"><p>In 1922 Selwyn Edge returned to Brooklands with Gwenda Jason for a historic simultaneous attempt at the automobile and motorcycle 'Double 12' (two 12 hour stints) world record. Gwenda was the only daughter of Major-General Sir Frederick Glubb, she is shown here on her 250cc Trump-JAP motorcycle. Selwyn Edge's auto was a 5.7 litre Spyker and he averaged 75 mph breaking thirty records for the combined 24 hour run. Edge brushed off the the achievements as a "holiday". Gwenda established the first 'Double 12' on a motorcycle with an average speed of just under 45 mph. She remarked afterward that she was "sustained, by tea and cigarettes". Gwenda was married to Colonel Janson the director of the Spyker car company, but the marriage wouldn't last long and she soon married Colonel Neil Stewart. She then went to the track at Montlhéry, France and established a new 24 hour word record with a Tarrot-JAP motorcycle. While in France she had an affair with Douglas Hawkes one of the mechanics she worked with during her record attempt. She married Hawkes and he bought her a 2-litre a Miller Special race car which she proceeded to break the one mile/kilometre speed record at over 234km/h (145mph) on the oval at Montlhéry between 1930 and 1933. Gwenda raced in the Le Mans 24-Hours twice driving a Maserati engined Derby race car, but without great success. In 1940 Gwenda and Douglas returned to England opening a mechanical engineering factory near Brooklands. Gwenda worked at making artillery shells for the duration of WWII.<br>ref: A Contemporary History of Women's Sport - By Jean Williams<br>ref: Fast Ladies: Female Racing Drivers 1888 to 1970 - By Jean François Bouzanquet</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="47"><!-- react-empty: 48 --></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="49"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="51"><a class="" data-reactid="52"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="53"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="54"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/60316f702d78d95d3bd3149b08df4331/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fde903cd1-5a55-43cb-ad33-f252443e6582.jpg&amp;width=546" style="object-position:74.72527472527473% 21.59090909090909%;" data-reactid="55"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/60316f702d78d95d3bd3149b08df4331/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fde903cd1-5a55-43cb-ad33-f252443e6582.jpg&amp;width=546" style="object-position:74.72527472527473% 21.59090909090909%;" data-reactid="56"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/60316f702d78d95d3bd3149b08df4331/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fde903cd1-5a55-43cb-ad33-f252443e6582.jpg&amp;width=546" style="object-position:74.72527472527473% 21.59090909090909%;" data-reactid="57"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d5f0cbca026d1007727f5861429eda02/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fde903cd1-5a55-43cb-ad33-f252443e6582.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:74.72527472527473% 21.59090909090909%;" data-reactid="58"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="546" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.6893939393939394" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/60316f702d78d95d3bd3149b08df4331/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fde903cd1-5a55-43cb-ad33-f252443e6582.jpg&amp;width=546" style="object-position:74.72527472527473% 21.59090909090909%;" data-reactid="59"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="60"><!-- react-empty: 61 --><!-- react-empty: 62 --><!-- react-empty: 63 --><!-- react-empty: 64 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="65"><!-- react-text: 66 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="67"><p data-reactid="68">NSU at the 1939 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy</p></div><!-- react-empty: 69 --><!-- react-empty: 70 --><!-- react-empty: 71 --></div><div class="Paragraph b { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;77670f99-cf71-44db-a423-1f2235163c15&quot;, &quot;item&quot;: &quot;880e786e-a38a-430e-aad2-071e057e7c5a&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;src&quot;: null, &quot;created_at&quot;: null, &quot;updated_at&quot;: null, &quot;ctaType&quot;: undefined, &quot;_title&quot;: undefined, &quot;_caption&quot;: undefined, &quot;_text&quot;: &quot;The Isle of Man Tourist Trophy is the toughest road race in the world and in 1939 it was also sadly a stage for Nazis propaganda. The German government was determined to dominate every international sporting event, and the TT races were no exception. BMW, DKW, and NSU entered motorcycles that were state of the art, with excellent riders and they had state support. The NSU team included Wilhelm Herz, John H White, Otto Rührschneck and Karl Bodmer. Bodmer is shown here on the 350cc Kompressor prior to the Junior. Norton chief engineer Walter William Moore (who had defected to NSU in 1929) and Albert Roder designed the engine.

The engine was originally built as a 500 cc TT racer for the Norton works team in 1927 and it was used in a road bike the following year, sharing the same frame and cycle parts as the pushrod ES2. Alec Bennett riding the CS1 on its first race won the Isle of Man Senior TT in 1927 and Stanley Woods set the fastest lap at 70.99 mph before retiring. In 1929, NSU hired Walter Moore away from Norton and he brought his drawings of Norton engines with him. The 1930 NSU SS 500 and 350 had all the characteristics of a Norton, so much so that the British began saying NSU actually stood for "Norton Spares Used." The SS 500 was an air-cooled transverse single cylinder overhead valve with a single bevel driven overhead camshaft. The bore was 80 mm and stroke 99 mm and could deliver 28 hp at 5,500 rpm. In 1937 Moore designed a twin overhead-cam 500cc and 350cc engine for the NSU works team of Heiner Fleischmann, Karl Bodmer and Werner Mellman. This photo is Karl Bodmer's 351 SSR and is the only surviving example, restored by German NSU specialist Karl Reese. The NSU 350 DOCH made 31hp at 7,000 rpm the 500 twin-cam version made 36hp at 6,000rpm.<br>ref:<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meisterdinger.de%2F&amp;h=CAQF-MXY7&amp;enc=AZOx-mi4aq8lQR4hh326xvfaXnFe86HSbHPdq8f9qAnuKW6YyZqhH-77Rw9FrWf80ecKD7t_tJMgFNQjffm2THa-F578ZLAq9BCMEMo19sRoH3MGWtWg5BRotObN-opc28065ZNP_zTSlV_ikA8C7Xdf&amp;s=1">www.meisterdinger.de</a>- Joachim Fritz</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="75"><!-- react-empty: 76 --></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="77"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="78"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2a5c2312-514f-477b-a153-33434ce95761.jpg" alt="NSU Works Team - 1938"><p>This is a great shot of the NSU works team in 1938. Karl Bodmer is on the double knocker twin cam 350cc single in the foreground and two NSU RK 350 twin compressor machines are just in front of him, ridden by Wilhelm Herz and Otto Rührschneck. The third bike in the photo is DKW's SS 350 a supercharged twin cylinder two-stroke. Earlier versions of the DKW machine had two different induction systems, the ULd featured a rotary valve while the ULe used a reed valve. A quick scan of the crowd reveals how dominate the Nazi presence was at sporting events in Germany just prior to the war. Karl Bodmer was a driving instructor for the NSKK (Nationalsozialistische Kraftfahrkorps) from 1940 to 1943 until being shipped off to Russia as a Panzer Division tank commander. After the war in 1946 Bodmer with a few comrades organized and participated in the first post war race in Germany. In 1947 he competed at Schauinsland and several other regional races on his prewar NSU bevel drive single before hanging up his helmet for health reasons. He devoted himself to family and opened a motorcycle and micro car dealership selling NSU, BMW, HOREX, VICTORIA, DKW, Vespa scooter and BMW Isetta, GUTBROD and Lloyd small cars.</p></div><div

Erich Wolf assumed the leadership of race department and developed a new 125cc, and 250cc two-stroke works racer. Germany was banned from international competition for the 1951 season and DKW spent the time making non supercharged two-strokes competitive with four-strokes. In 1952 a 3 cylinder 350cc machine was introduced with a nearly horizontal cylinder between two nearly vertical cylinders. The machine had a four speed gearbox and produced 46 hp and was capable of 140mph! The machine was so thirsty that it required a huge alloy fuel tank. By 1954 Robert Eberhost (via Porsche) was now in charge of the works development and he put engineer Helmut Georg in charge of the 350cc triple. The machine gained 38mm Dellortos, a bevel driven Bosch magneto and huge four leading shoe brakes front and rear. A streamlined hand hammered aluminum fairing was developed at the Munich Technical College's wind tunnel and used on the track. The motor would now make peak power at 9500 rpm and with August Hobl on board, DKW won the German Championship and took third in the World Championship in 1954.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="140"><!-- react-empty: 141 --></div></section><section id="12" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-medium color-bg color-title section-height-fullscreen section-bgcover-and fx-r a-i-end j-c-end  text-align-left group-graphical-shape-none  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="142"><div class="Bg op-50" data-reactid="143"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="144"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="145"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f100b50de317e1372aed827f9a5bd62/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="146"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f100b50de317e1372aed827f9a5bd62/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="147"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8ca3dca6b9be91caa6ae0835aaacfb93/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="148"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2654af1410f0938435f7e2eb9d4d9fc1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="149"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="611" data-ratio="1.2962356792144025" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f100b50de317e1372aed827f9a5bd62/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="150"/></picture></div></div><div class="Component p-h-1 ls-p-h-10 ls-w-50p p-v-2 ls-p-v-8 fx-c a-i-end j-c-end d-ib " data-reactid="151"><div class="p-1 ls-p-2 w-100p ls-min-w-320px pos-r color-box bx-sh-soft" data-reactid="152"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="153"><a class="" data-reactid="154"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="155"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="156"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f100b50de317e1372aed827f9a5bd62/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="157"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f100b50de317e1372aed827f9a5bd62/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="158"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8ca3dca6b9be91caa6ae0835aaacfb93/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="159"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2654af1410f0938435f7e2eb9d4d9fc1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="160"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="611" data-ratio="1.2962356792144025" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f100b50de317e1372aed827f9a5bd62/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2db8067-12c0-4b5c-83ad-e9862c75998c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:61.111111111111114% 89.03436988543372%;" data-reactid="161"/></picture></div></a><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="162"><!-- react-text: 163 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="164"><p data-reactid="165">DKW RM350 -

Bettmann had been working as a translator and foreign correspondent when he established the S. Bettmann &amp; Co, Import Export Agency selling bicycles made in Englandre-branded as "Bettmann" and importing German made sewing machines. In 1886, Siegfried replaces the brand name Bettmann with the name Triumph, because he felt like the name might have a more universal appeal. Initially, he registered his company as New Triumph Co. Ltd. but later changed the name to “The Triumph Cycle Company.” In 1887 having received some financial investment from the Dunlop Tyre Company, Siegfried hires an engineer from his home town of Nuremberg named Mauritz Johann Schulte as a junior partner in the firm. Schulte convinces Bettmann that they should manufacture their own products rather than sell other companies products and in 1888 they start to make their own bicycles. Around 1895 the company starts looking into manufacturing motorcycles under license and even imports an example of the Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller cycle for analysis and testing ( H&amp;W was the world's first production motorcycle). In 1896, Bettmann opens a second bicycle factory in Nuremberg, called Triumph-Werke Nürnberg AG (TWN). In 1902 the first Triumph motorcycle is produced, designed by Schulte, using a Belgian/Minerva 2.25 HO, single-cylinder engine.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="201"><!-- react-empty: 202 --></div></section><section id="16" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="203"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="204"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="205"><a class="" data-reactid="206"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="207"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="208"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ad23345aeb2bf80e1d411561460987aa/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffe299314-37ef-4028-a1c6-f1c35311563c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:45.95959595959596% 14.440433212996389%;" data-reactid="209"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ad23345aeb2bf80e1d411561460987aa/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffe299314-37ef-4028-a1c6-f1c35311563c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:45.95959595959596% 14.440433212996389%;" data-reactid="210"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0458d9747343565505749486c44c7fdc/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffe299314-37ef-4028-a1c6-f1c35311563c.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:45.95959595959596% 14.440433212996389%;" data-reactid="211"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e8fac15bfa28102a85531c524dd4334b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffe299314-37ef-4028-a1c6-f1c35311563c.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:45.95959595959596% 14.440433212996389%;" data-reactid="212"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="554" data-ratio="1.4296028880866427" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ad23345aeb2bf80e1d411561460987aa/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffe299314-37ef-4028-a1c6-f1c35311563c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:45.95959595959596% 14.440433212996389%;" data-reactid="213"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="214"><!-- react-empty: 215 --><!-- react-empty: 216 --><!-- react-empty: 217 --><!-- react-empty: 218 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="219"><!-- react-text: 220 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="221"><p data-reactid="222">Tazio Giorgio Nuvolari i Bianchi</p></div><!-- react-empty: 223 --><!-- react-empty: 224 --><!-- react-empty: 225 --></div><div class="Paragraph b { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;d4852245-fd79-4bf4-9a72-85ad286c3f7f&quot;, &quot;item&quot;: &quot;87a1e4eb-2cbc-49f9-bbf4-5b6fcb74dbc4&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;src&quot;: null, &quot;created_at&quot;: null, &quot;updated_at&quot;: null, &quot;ctaType&quot;: undefined, &quot;_title&quot;: undefined, &quot;_caption&quot;: undefined, &quot;_text&quot;: &quot;Tazio Giorgio Nuvolari and his team mates with the Bianchi 348cc \&quot;Freccia Celeste\&quot; works machine circa 1926.

The sloping stressed member concept was patented in 1900 by Joah (\"John\") Carver Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner. After Harry Rayner died in a car accident, Joah went into partnership with Richard Moore and P&M motorcycles was established. I've always admired the large heavyweight sloping 40-degree, \"Panther\" single-cylinderengine's masculine appearance. The first Panther was launched in 1924 and was promoted as \"The Perfected Motorcycle\". You often see Panthers attached to sidecars, a task they are well suited for thanks to its large flywheels and high torque output.

A railway engineer designed the banked curves to allow speeds up to 90mph but by the 1930's racers were reaching speeds well over 130mph. It was 100ft wide and the length was three and a quarter miles, of which two miles were level. The banking on one end was 25ft 8\" inches high and the opposite end was 28ft 8\" inches high. The surface was built of gravel and Portland concrete, not the new and prohibitively expensive asphalt and as such was very bumpy. More than a 1,000 men were involved in the construction financed by Hugh and Ethel Locke King. The Brooklands Automobile Racing Club (BARC) was formed in December 1906 a month before the track was completed. By January of 1907 Hugh Locke King has a nervous breakdown and was close to bankruptcy from cost over runs, Ethel took over control and was able to raise more funds from family and friends.

The engine was originally built as a 500 cc TT racer for the Norton works team in 1927 and it was used in a road bike the following year, sharing the same frame and cycle parts as the pushrod ES2. Alec Bennett riding the CS1 on its first race won the Isle of Man Senior TT in 1927 and Stanley Woods set the fastest lap at 70.99 mph before retiring. In 1929, NSU hired Walter Moore away from Norton and he brought his drawings of Norton engines with him. The 1930 NSU SS 500 and 350 had all the characteristics of a Norton, so much so that the British began saying NSU actually stood for \"Norton Spares Used.\" The SS 500 was an air-cooled transverse single cylinder overhead valve with a single bevel driven overhead camshaft. The bore was 80 mm and stroke 99 mm and could deliver 28 hp at 5,500 rpm.

The engine block is finned and water cooled, looking similar to a square four. Mechanically it has five pistons, four 39.5mm pistons, plus a 100mm supercharging piston, all spinning on a common crankshaft by six con rods.

During the first world war Toni flew aerial reconnaissance missions and was later a decorated fighter pilot. After WWI he worked on the development of the Megola, a motorcycle powered by a 640 cc five-cylinder radial engine in the front wheel. From 1921-1924 Bauhofer and his teammates Josef Stelzer and Albin Tommasi were very successful racing the Megola, even winning the inaugural German Motorcycle Championship in 1924. After leaving Megola-Werke he became a works rider for BMW from 1925 to1929. In 1927 won at the Nürburgring in the 500cc class and in 1928 he again won the German 1000 cc Championship. In 1929 became a works rider for DKW, winning the 1930 and 1932 500cc German Championships. Toni also raced cars for DKW between 1931 and 1934, driving a DKW F1 single-seater.

He won the Nations Grand Prix four times between 1925 and 1928, and the Lario Circuit race five times between 1925 and 1929, all in the 350cc class on a Bianchi Freccia Celeste motorcycle.</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"30e45d05-737c-412d-bc7c-e202d6c6f9b9":{"id":"30e45d05-737c-412d-bc7c-e202d6c6f9b9","index":15,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-24T16:15:55.691Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T16:16:48.098Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-24-tazio-nuvolari-won-the-circuito-del-lario-roadrace-often-ca.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"tazio-nuvolari-won-the-circuito-del-lario-roadrace-often-ca/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"Tazio Nuvolari won the Circuito del Lario roadrace, often called the Italian TT in 1929.
