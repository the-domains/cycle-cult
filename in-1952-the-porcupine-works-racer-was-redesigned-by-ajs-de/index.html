The new design had retained the same internal components but the parallel cylinders were now angled upward at a 45 degree angle providing better cooling and a shorter wheelbase. The distinctive spiked cooling fins that gave the original E90 it’s nickname were now gone on the new design but race fans and the racing press continued to refer to the new E95 as a “Porcupine”. The new machine sported a huge “full gallon” fuel tank that extended down on both sides of the engine further lowering the center of gravity and providing some streamlining with deep cutouts for the riders knees. A fuel pump was now needed to raise petrol to the carburetors. This arrangement also meant that to start the bike the pit crew would stand the bike vertically balancing it on the rear wheel to flood the float chambers with fuel. Two 28.6 mm Amal GP carbs feed the 68mm bore x 68.5mm stroke, almost square engine. It now also featured a long underslung oil sump, and pressed-up crankshaft with one-piece connecting rods and roller big-ends. At the 1949 Isle of Man TT Leslie Graham was forced to retire just two minutes from the finish line with a failure of it’s gear driven magneto on the AJS E90. The E95 adopted a chain driven aircraft magneto which solved that problem. The camshaft housing and various engine covers were magnesium alloy as were the front and rear hubs. The E95 was first raced at the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix with Jack Brett taking first place, Bill Doran in second and Rod Coleman coming in 5th at the season opener. But by 1953 the AJS was relegated to tenth place so for the 1954 season AMC’s new development engineer Jack Williams continued development on the bike lowering the engine in the frame and getting 54bhp at 7,800rpm from the engine. The riders for the 1954 season were Bob McIntyre, Derek Farrant and Rod Coleman with Coleman finishing second at Ulster and winning the Swedish Grand Prix. In 1954 Charlie Collier the founder of AMC died and AJS withdrew from GP racing at the end of the season. The Porcupine racers of which only four E90 and four E95’s were built had entered 24 GP races winning 5 and coming in second in seven with one World Championship in 1949. Only one E90 machine survives, the factory scrapped the others, thankfully all four E95 machines. A 1954 AJS E95 Porcupine was sold post-auction at Bonham’s in 2011, for a reputed $675,000!</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
