<p>In post WWII England there were dozens of airfields being used for motorcycle and automotive racing including sprints. Thurleigh, Bedfordshire was originally a RAF base, it was handed over to the US 8th AF, 306th Bombardment Group known as 'The Reich wreckers' in September 1942. It was the first base in England to be handed over completely to the Americans allowing them sovereignty and full control over the area. The Group flew 341 daylight missions in B17 Flying Fortresses between October 1942 and April 1945 and were the first US Bomb group to fly a combat mission over Nazi Germany. Even now Thurleigh is home to FIA Formula 2 races. This is a photo of George Brown's "Nero" at Thurleigh airfield without it's streamlined fairing. George and Cliff Brown were early adopters of aerodynamics, finding benefits of up to 20mph even in 1/4 mile sprints. In 1961 on a faired "Nero" George set the Standing Start Kilometre World Record for up to 1000cc machines with a run of 20.505 seconds hitting the trap at 108.73 mph. Cliff Brown was able to sort out a misfire in the rear cylinder caused by trapped piston rings the night before Sunday's record attempt. George also set the British Standing Start Kilo Record in 250, 350 and 500cc classes on an Ariel Arrow special supplied to him by the Selly Oak company that same weekend!<br>ref:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Thurleigh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Thurleigh</a><br>ref:<a href="http://vincent.gkhost.co.uk/George-Brown">http://vincent.gkhost.co.uk/George-Brown</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
