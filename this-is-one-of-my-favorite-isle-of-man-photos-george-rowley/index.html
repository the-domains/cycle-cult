Motorcycle design just prior to WW2 was advancing at a staggering pace with all kinds of unusual and revolutionary engine layouts being developed. Collier &amp; Sons launched their AJS 500cc V-4 at the Olympia Motor Cycle Show in London in 1935. Designed by Bert Collier, the AJS design was similar to another V-4 Collier engine design, the 1931 593cc Matchless 'Silver Hawk'. The AJS V-4 was technologically advanced 500cc 50ยบ chain-driven SOHC engine, with exposed 'hairpin' valve springs. Although it debuted at the Olympia show as a tourer the machine never went into production and only a few bikes were built. In the spring of 1936 AJS began testing a new racing version of the V-4 at Brooklands. The new machine now had alloy barrels and sported a supercharger designed by Swiss engineer Arnold Zoller. The supercharged V4 produced 55hp and had a top speed of 135mph, it was designed to compete against BMW's Kompressor machines. BMW had been developing supercharged racers for sometime, starting in 1929 with Ernest Henne's 134.6 mph land speed record. The AJS V-4's supercharger was mounted in the front and was driven at half engine speed, and fed by a single Amal TT carburetor. The engine was mounted in the same frame as the 500 cc OHC single TT racers, and used a four-speed Burman gearbox with a dry clutch. Harold Daniell and George Rowley rode the AJS supercharged V4s in the Isle of Man Senior TT, but despite its high top speed, it was heavy, and did not handle well. The bikes were also plagued with carbonation troubles and lacked acceleration. Both riders retired due to mechanical problems. Single cylinder machines would again dominate the TT with Freddie Firth winning on his Norton with a record speed. AJS would continue to develop the V-4 turning to liquid cooling in 1939 utilizing a cast alloy engine with enclosed valve springs. Between 1936 and 1939, the AJS V-4 set several records, breaking the 100 mph lap speed record at the Ulster Grand Prix.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
