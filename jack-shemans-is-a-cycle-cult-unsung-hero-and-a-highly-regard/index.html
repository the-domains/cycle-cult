(Norton Triumph Villers). Jack's father, George Shemans was the chauffeur of Triumph founder Siegfried Bettman and a works team rider. George rose through the ranks of Triumph holding a number of important jobs within the company and enjoying success racing a wide range of events including the Continental Circus, ISDT, endurance runs at Brooklands and even the wooden board tracks of the prewar era. Young Jack Shemans attended trade school landing a job with Daimler upon graduation later working on Whitley and Lancaster bombers at Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. Jack also served with the Naval Bombardment Unit in North Africa. After the war Jack went to work for Triumph eventually moving from the engine production line into the experimental department with Arthur Jakeman and Doug Hele. One of the first racing projects Jack worked on was developing the 500cc T100 for rider Percy Tait. At the Belgian G.P., Percy Tait came in second to Agostini and MV with average speed of 116 m.p.h. There were wins at Daytona In 1966 and 1967 with 500cc engines Jack built and Malcolm Uphill's "Thruxton" 100 m.p.h. production lap. Jack boosted the output of the "Triples" from the original 58 hp to 85 hp. When the Meriden works closed Jack, went to N.V.T. at Kitts Green working on a number of experimental projects including 4-cylinder "Quadrant" engine from two triple engines. Jack joined Norman Hyde after the Kitts Green shop closed. At Norman Hyde he built both road and race engines contributing to the development of many new products. Even after he left Norman Hyde Jack continued building engines in his own shop until retiring.</p><p>ref: <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.triples.co.uk%2F&amp;h=DAQHOxr-i&amp;enc=AZM6OQE2xVxTbsbaDLES7gwsf07UCji8HaV4d0m0CIcGcp5kp2gKD1A2bgAu9iCBKGDvCjKZ6qwljpjnghg8NRbdmy1Ok6wE-4n4GvAY52yNXDRCrT7goFmr4a2dDOLCiuO0OABWAhqll43QJh3b0ElA&amp;s=1">www.triples.co.uk</a></p><p>photo: © Jack Shemans</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
