But this was 1969 and the kids were into psychedelic rock now. The previous year in 1968, while touring Germany, Vincent fired four shots from a revolver at Gary Glitter for messing around with his girlfriend (too bad he missed). The very next day a petrified Glitter was on the next available flight back to the UK and when a badly hungover Gene Vincent was woken up the next day he claimed not to remember anything about the night before.</p><p>Gene was hoping 1969 would go smoother, he signed a new record contract with Elektra in Los Angeles, and was to be represented in England by BBC disc jockey John Peel’s Dandelion label. On September 13th 1969 Vincent plays the the Toronto Rock ‘N’ Rock Revival Show. The show was to feature some of the greatest rock stars that had ever lived including Bo Diddley, Junior Walker, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and up-and-coming young stars The Doors and Alice Cooper. There wasn't much interest in the 50's rockers, the Beatles were the biggest band on Earth. So it wasn't till John Lennon who hadn't played a gig in three years was to show up with The Plastic Ono Band (which included Eric Clapton on guitar) that ticket sales sold out. Vincent was backed by Alice Cooper and his band for the show. It was at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival that the Alice Cooper "chicken incident" took place with Alice supposedly biting the chicken's head off before returning it to the crowd.</p><p>That fall Vincent would record the album I'm Back and I'm Proud for John Peel's Dandelion label with a young Linda Ronstadt on backing vocals. The tour of France and England would go poorly with a road-weary Vincent backed by the Wild Angels. Gene was in a great deal of pain from previous injuries. In July 1955 on a Triumph motorcycle Gene crashed shattering his left leg. He refused to have it amputated. The leg was saved, but the crash left him with a limp and chronic pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg for the rest of his life. While on tour with Eddie Cochran in 1960, Gene was involved in a high-speed traffic accident riding in a taxi. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg. Cochran was thrown from the vehicle and suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.</p><p>There is a documentary that was filmed in November of 1969 that follows Vincent on four days of the UK tour filmed by the BBC. The film takes you into a uniquely British world of tiny dance halls and cheap hotels on the Isle of Wight. Gene was flat broke at this point and in the film Gene struggles to get promoters and TV producers to pay him.
