  "Flying Freddie" Dixon takes a spill in the hairpin at Le Mans on 7/24/1921.
  The hairpin near the river Sartre Pontlieue bridge was permanently removed
  from the circuit in 1929. Number 23 Jack Emerson also riding a Douglas, is hot
  on Dixon's tail. Emerson set 3 World's Records in 1912 at Brooklands aboard a
  Norton 16H 490cc TT which was Norton's first purpose-built racing machine.
  Alec Bennett won the 1921 Senior 500cc French Grand Prix on a long stroke 3.5
  hp Sunbeam TT with an average speed of 58.31 mph.
