  Gilera's involvement in international racing started in 1935 with the purchase
  of the supercharged 4 cylinder Rondine racers acquired by the Caproni Aircraft
  company. Mussolini had ascended to power and he wanted to leverage GP racing
  as a political statement like the Germans. Italian motorcycle manufacturers
  were instructed to produce winning racing machines. Piero Taruffi had achieved
  great success with the water-cooled Rondines and he came to work for Gilera as
  part of the deal. Guiseppe Gilera and Taruffi began sorting out the machine's
  reliability problems by focusing their attention on the crankshaft bearings.
  The Rondine's handling issues were also resolved with modifications to the
  frame and tweaks to the blower. The new Gilera four was raced at all the big
  European racing events. In 1937 in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Giordano
  Aldrighetti beat the BMW and Moto Guzzi teams to score the Gilera fourâ€™s first
  Grand Prix victory. Piero Taruffi and the Gilera 4 would go on to break fifty
  world speed records including 170 mph for the flying kilometer.

Gilera's involvement in international racing started in 1935 with the purchase of the supercharged 4 cylinder Rondine racers acquired by the Caproni Aircraft company. Mussolini had ascended to power and he wanted to leverage GP racing as a political statement like the Germans. Italian motorcycle manufacturers were instructed to produce winning racing machines. Piero Taruffi had achieved great success with the water-cooled Rondines and he came to work for Gilera as part of the deal. Guiseppe Gilera and Taruffi began sorting out the machine's reliability problems by focusing their attention on the crankshaft bearings. The Rondine's handling issues were also resolved with modifications to the frame and tweaks to the blower. The new Gilera four was raced at all the big European racing events. In 1937 in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Giordano Aldrighetti beat the BMW and Moto Guzzi teams to score the Gilera four's first Grand Prix victory. Piero Taruffi and the Gilera 4 would go on to break fifty world speed records including 170 mph for the flying kilometer.

Piero Remor one of the original designers of the engine was hired by Guiseppe Gilera in 1940 to work on a next generation engine. Remor designed a supercharged 250cc 4 cylinder that was air-cooled, the engine was built but never raced. WWII of course threw a wrench in things and Italy was crushed. All racing stopped until 1946\. After the war superchargers were banned by the F.I.M., the Rondine engine was modified but by now outdated and slow. Taruffi left in 1946 to focus on auto racing so in 1947 Gilera ask Remor to design a new 500cc racer. In the spring of 1948 the new racer was unveiled. It was similar in many ways to the earlier air cooler 250cc and it weighed a mere 270 lbs and produced 48bhp. The new racer was not without problems, rider Nello Pagani described it as 'unrideable'. The development continued and by the end of 1949 Pagani had two Grand Prix victories. At the end of the 1949 season Piero Remor was disgruntled over compensation and quit Gilera to join MV Agusta. You can imagine how Guiseppe Gilera felt when MV Agusta introduced their 500cc racer in the spring of 1950 and it was a blueprint of the Gilera.
