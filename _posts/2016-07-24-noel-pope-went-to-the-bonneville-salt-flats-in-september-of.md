  Noel Pope went to the Bonneville Salt Flats in September of 1949 with his now
  streamlined supercharged Brough Superior with the intentions of setting a new
  world motorcycle speed record. At the time Ernest Henne held the record at 174
  mph on a supercharged BMW set in 1937. Pope's streamlined Brough nicknamed
  "Silver Fish" because of it's polished aluminum body shell was expected to
  reach a top speed of over 200 mph. On a test run without the shell Noel
  reached 140 mph but on his first timed run with the streamlining he crashed at
  a speed of 150 mph. Pope managed to stumble away from the crash without
  serious injury but vowed to never ride a streamlined motorcycle again!  ref:
