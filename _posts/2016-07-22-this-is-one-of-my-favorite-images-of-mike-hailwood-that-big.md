  This is one of my favorite images of Mike Hailwood. That big grin from the
  normally shy racer wearing a helmet with a caricature drawing of himself is
  just perfect. One of my favorite stories about Hailwood the man is from his
  automotive racing days. In 1973 at the South African Grand Prix, Hailwood and
  Clay Regazzoni crashed. Regazzoni's car caught fire and he was knocked
  unconscious. With disregard for his own safety, Hailwood tried to pull Clay
  from the burning car igniting his own clothing. Mike was waving his arms
  around frantically in an attempt to put out the flames when a corner marshal
  arrived with a fire extinguisher and put the flames on his clothes out.
  Regazzoni's car was still engulfed in flames, but Mike went right back in and
  pulled Clay to safety likely saving the drivers life.
