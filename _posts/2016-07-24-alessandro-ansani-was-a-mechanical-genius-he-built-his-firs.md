  Alessandro Ansani was a mechanical genius! He built his first motor a
  lightweight twin cylinder engine in a small workshop in St. Naizaire. In 1905
  riding a 330cc single cylinder motorcycle with an engine of his own design he
  set a speed record of 100 km an hour at the Velodrome in Antwerp and his
  career as designer took off. Anzani set up shop near Paris, designing and
  constructing engines and motor cycles. One of the early engines, the 25 hp
  Anzani W-3 or Fan type, was supplied to Louis Blériot who used it on his
  successful crossing of the English Channel in 1909 claiming the prize of
  25,000 Francs. The notoriety from Blériot's flight brought fame and orders for
  all types of engines to Ansani. Alessandro Anzani & Co was established in 1911
  as a manufacturer to supply the growing demand for engines, primarily 6 and 20
  cylinder aero-radials. On November 20th 1912 the British Anzani Engine Company
  was established to supply the British aviation market. In 1914 Ansani built
  another factory in Monza, Italy to produce 10-cylinder double-star
  aero-radials. Alessandro Anzani decided to retire in 1926 just prior to his
  50th birthday and disposed of his factories with the exception of the Monza
  factory. The British Anzani group would continue producing motorized products
  such as light tractors, lawnmowers and outboard motors until it went into
  liquidation in 1980. Cotton, Tandon and Greeves motorcycles used Anzani
  motors. Alessandro Ansani is photographed here in 1907 wearing his familiar
  cap on a 35 hp "Omnia" slayer velo rider pacer cycle.
