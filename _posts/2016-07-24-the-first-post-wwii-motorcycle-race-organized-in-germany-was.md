  The first post WWII motorcycle race organized in Germany was from Baiersbronn
  to Hearthstone on July 21,1946 and was organized by Karl Bodmer and some of
  his prewar racing buddies. This is a photo of Karl at the start of the race on
  his trusty bevel driven double over head cam NSU 351 SSR single cylinder
  racer. The Germans often call these types of races hill climbs but it's not
  like the American sense of the word they were road races on mountain roads and
  were extremely dangerous. Even now when driving these mountain roads you will
  often see a small marker where a rider lost his life in competition.
