  The Isle of Man Tourist Trophy is the toughest road race in the world and in
  1939 it was also sadly a stage for Nazis propaganda. The German government was
  determined to dominate every international sporting event, and the TT races
  were no exception. BMW, DKW, and NSU entered motorcycles that were state of
  the art, with excellent riders and they had state support. The NSU team
  included Wilhelm Herz, John H White, Otto Rührschneck and Karl Bodmer. Bodmer
  is shown here on the 350cc Kompressor prior to the Junior. Norton chief
  engineer Walter William Moore (who had defected to NSU in 1929) and Albert
  Roder designed the engine. Unfortunately the machines while incredibly fast,
  were as the Germans say "unripe" and remarkably unreliable. Karl Bodmer would
  retire from both the senior and the junior TT races with mechanical problems.
  The Germans would end up standing on the podium winning the senior with Georg
  Meier and his BMW Kompressor but were denied the junior which was won by
  Stanley Woods on a Velocette and the lightweight was won by Ted Mellors on a
  Benelli.
