  By 1909, former champion bicycle racer Jack Prince had built the Los Angeles
  Coliseum Motordrome, a velodrome-like motorcycle racing facility that was just
  over 1⁄4 mile (0.40 km) in circumference. The first board track built
  specifically for motorsport racing in the US was the circular Los Angeles
  Motordrome built in 1910. It was a 1.0 mile (1.6 km) scaled-up version of a
  bicycling velodrome built by Jack Prince and mechanical engineer Frederick
  Moskovics in Playa del Rey near Los Angeles. That first track in Playa del Rey
  was banked at a 3:1 pitch (about 20 degrees), but later tracks were built with
  higher banking and some motorcycle tracks were banked up to 60 degrees. In
  1919 Jack Prince built the 1.25 mi (2.01 km) Beverly Hills Speedway (also
  called the Los Angeles Speedway) wooden board track for motorcycle and
  automobile racing with Arthur Pillsbury. Prince and Pillsbury had set out to
  build the fastest race track in the nation. Pillsbury should be credited with
  the design as it was his studies of a method used by railroads, called the
  Searle Spiral Easement Curve, that was used to design the track's layout and
  contours. According to Pillsbury, a correctly engineered track could be driven
  without steering input from the driver, the car would steer itself, simply due
  to the track geometry. Board tracks were exceedingly dangerous due to flying
  wood splinters and debris, and due to sudden catastrophic tire failures caused
  by track conditions. The Los Angeles Speedway track was treated with a coating
  made from crushed sea shells to improve traction! A major contributor to the
  demise of board tracks was the high cost of maintenance, tracks needed new
  boards every five years on average. Carpenters would often repair the tracks
  from below, sometimes even during a race. The last championship race on timber
  was held at the infamous Altoona Speedway in 1931, motorcycle board track
  racing was completely dead by the 1940’s.
