  Noel Pope competed at the Isle of Man TT sometimes in both the Junior and
  Senior races from 1933 to 1939 and after the war in 1947 and 48. He placed 5th
  in the Senior on a Norton Manx in 1936 and again in 1948, his best finishes at
  the TT. He's photographed here at the 1938 TT on a Velocette MK6 KTT, although
  he would DNF in both the Junior and the Senior in 38. But he had previously
  ridden a Velo to 12th place in 1936, 14th in 1939 and 25th in 1947. There's a
  great article on the Velocette MK6 KTT at the link below.
