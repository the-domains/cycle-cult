  From May to August of 1935, Joe Petrali won every Class A national race, 10 in
  a row! Incredibly during the 1930's, Joe also found the time to get married to
  Florence (shown here with the cap and sunglasses) in 1933. Hank Syvertsen
  Harley-Davidson's race department director is also in this photo, attending to
  Joe's motorcycle. In 1931 alone he won eight of the 16 dirt track and hill
  climb AMA nationals. Petrali dominated the Class A American racing scene in
  the 1930's, winning both the AMA hill climbing and track racing national
  titles in 1932, '33, '35, and '36.
