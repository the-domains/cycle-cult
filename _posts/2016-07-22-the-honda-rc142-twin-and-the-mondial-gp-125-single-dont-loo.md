  The Honda RC142 twin and the Mondial GP 125 single don't look similar but
  there is a connection. Soichiro Honda and his young engineer Kiyoshi Kawashima
  were very impressed with the european GP machines and especially the Mondial
  125 single. The dohc racer was designed in 1948 by Alfredo Drusiani for
  Mondial's Count Giuseppe Boselli. The four-stroke alloy unit-construction
  engine had twin overhead camshafts driven by a shaft-and-bevel system, with an
  outside flywheel, and straight-cut primary gears. It produced 11hp with a bore
  and stroke of 53x56mm, with 9.7:1 compression. By 1957, with some help from
  designer Fabio Taglioni, the dohc Mondial had a dual plug head and was
  producing 19hp at 13,200rpm! After winning the first three places in the 1957
  250cc championship and taking the 125cc title Mondial with other italian
  manufacturers withdrew from grand prix racing. Soichiro Honda contacted
  Mondial about the possibility of aquiring one of the now obsolete 125engines.
  To his surprise Mondial agreed and an engine was shipped off to Japan. Kiyoshi
  Kawashima and Honda gained a great deal of knowledge from the now three year
  old Mondial design and applied that to the Honda RC142 works machine.
