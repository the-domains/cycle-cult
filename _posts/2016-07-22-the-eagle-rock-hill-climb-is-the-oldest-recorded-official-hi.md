This rider has reached "the point of no return". An Aviation term, the point of no return is the point beyond which one must continue on one's current course of action because turning back is physically impossible. PNR (point of no return) is more often referred to by fighter pilots as the "Radius of Action formula" a technical term in air navigation that refers to the point on a flight at which, due to fuel consumption, a plane is no longer capable of returning to the airfield from which it took off. Actually this fellow has just past the center of gravity and no amount of torque is going to find his balance point again. That's going to leave a mark for sure. A reminder to Cycle Cultist's in the Mid West that the Devils Staircase 66th annual AMA Pro Hillclimb races are Sunday October 11th. Don't miss this event!
