  tuning wizard at the Meriden factory and later N.T.V. (Norton Triumph
  Villers). Jack's father, George Shemans was the chauffeur of Triumph founder
  Siegfried Bettman and a works team rider. George rose through the ranks of
  Triumph holding a number of important jobs within the company and enjoying
  success racing a wide range of events including the Continental Circus, ISDT,
  endurance runs at Brooklands and even the wooden board tracks of the prewar
  era. Young Jack Shemans attended trade school landing a job with Daimler upon

  Whitworth Aircraft. Jack also served with the Naval Bombardment Unit in North
  Africa. After the war Jack went to work for Triumph eventually moving from the
  engine production line into the experimental department with Arthur Jakeman

  the 500cc T100 for rider Percy Tait. At the Belgian G.P., Percy Tait came in
  second to Agostini and MV with average speed of 116 m.p.h. There were wins at
  Daytona In 1966 and 1967 with 500cc engines Jack built and Malcolm Uphill's
  "Thruxton" 100 m.p.h. production lap. Jack boosted the output of the "Triples"
  from the original 58 hp to 85 hp. When the Meriden works closed Jack, went to
  N.V.T. at Kitts Green working on a number of experimental projects including
  4-cylinder "Quadrant" engine from two triple engines. Jack joined Norman Hyde
  after the Kitts Green shop closed. At Norman Hyde he built both road and race
  engines contributing to the development of many new products. Even after he
  left Norman Hyde Jack continued building engines in his own shop until
  retiring.
