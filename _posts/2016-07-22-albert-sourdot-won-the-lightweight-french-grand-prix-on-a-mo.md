  Albert Sourdot won the lightweight French Grand Prix on a Monet-Goyon powered
  by a 175cc Villers 2-stroke engine an amazing 6 times. Albert won first in
  1924, 25, 27, 28, 29, and again in 1930 (in 1926 Sourdot tied for first with
  Alexandre Hommaire who also rode a Monet-Goyon). Sourdot also won the 175cc
  Class in the Bol d'Or race, covering 290 laps (940 miles) in the Forest of
  Fontainbleau, at a speed of 42mph! At the Montlhéry Race Track in France,
  Monet Goyon took the World Standing Start and Flying Kilometre Class Records
  with Albert Sourdot riding, and the 175cc Class World Records for 500km at
  51.2mph - 1,000km at 50.3mph - 1,500km at 50.75mph - 2,000km at 52.06mph.
  Monet-Goyon motorcycles were made in France from about 1917 to 1959. The
  factory was located in Mâcon, in the Saône-et-Loire region of Burgundy. The
  Mâcon factory also built Koehler Escoffier motorcycles and manufactured
  Villiers 2 stroke engines under license as well as motorcycles utilizing Swiss
  MAG brand 4 stroke engines up until 1939. After the end of World War II,
  Monet-Goyon resumed production of small displacement motorcycles and scooters
  until finally closing its doors at the end of the 1950’s.
