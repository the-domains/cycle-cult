  Giuliano Maoggi on a Ducati Marianna 125cc at the Motogiro d'Italia races in
  1956. This picture was taken when Maoggi won overall 1st place, a victory that
  played a large part in saving Ducati from possible closure. Giuseppe Montano
  the Director of Ducati, had recently hired Fabio Taglioni with the hope that
  he could design a motorcycle that would win the Motogiro. Italian resistance
  motorcycle races were extremely popular in Italy in the 1950s and Montano
  wanted the spotlight on Ducati. The most prestigious races at the time were
  the "Motogiro d'Italia" and the "Milano-Taranto", two road races that crossed
  the Italian peninsula and thus attracted the attention of people from across
  the country. A win in the "Motogiro d'Italia" meant fame for Maoggi (nicknamed
  "il duca italiano" the Italian duke), and boosted sales of Ducati motorcycles.
  By February of 1955, Taglioni had produced the first prototype of the 100cc
  Gran Sport, known as Marianna. After some testing at the high speed track in
  Modena the Marianna was officially presented to the public on March 5th, 1955.
  Thirty seven 100cc Gran Sport motorcycles competed in the Motogiro d'Italia on
  April 17th thru the 25th, in 1955. Out of the 200 riders that contacted Ducati
  to participate in the race, 25 were chosen for the official Ducati factory
  works team (while independent riders rode the remaining 12 Mariannas).
