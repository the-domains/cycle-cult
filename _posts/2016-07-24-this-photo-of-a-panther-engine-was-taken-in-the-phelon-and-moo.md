  This photo of a Panther engine was taken in the Phelon & Moore factory at
  Cleckheaton, Yorkshire, England. The Royal Flying Corps used P&M motorcycles
  during the First World War, and they were selected by the RAC when they added
  sidecars to their range of vehicles in 1922. Around 1924 P&M decided to enter
  a new machine into the Isle of Man TT. The TT Entrant machines had a 25 bhp
  498cc, 6.5:1 compression ratio, 84 x 90 mm, ohv sloper engine with a
  four-speed close ratio gearbox. They were produced through to 1928 and in
  later years TT Replica machines were sold to the public.
