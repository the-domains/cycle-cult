  Joseph Berliner the US distributor for Ducati was so influential in the
  lucrative American motorcycle market that in 1959 he approached Ducati about
  creating a rival to the Harley-Davidson to sell to police departments around
  the US. Berliner agreed to underwrite a portion of the development costs in
  1961 and in 1964 Ducati delivered to Berliner a prototype of the "1260
  Apollo", a 1,257 cc (76.7 cu in) V4 engine motorcycle producing 100 bhp (75
  kW) and capable of over 120 mph (190 km/h). Fabio Taglioni had been asked to
  develop a bike that conformed to US police specifications, and was bigger than
  any current model Harley-Davidson. Taglioni decided on an air-cooled 1257 cc
  90° two-valve head V4 using a 180-degree crankshaft with roller bearing big
  ends. That crankshaft fitted into a horizontally split wet sump crankcase with
  a center main bearing support. The bore was 84.5 mm, and the stroke 56 mm.
  Valve actuation was by pushrods and rocker arms. Ducati produced two
  prototypes (one of which was delivered to Berliner) and two extra engines as
  spares but the Apollo was sadly never put into production. The prototype was
  sold by Mike Berliner to Bob Schanz of Cincinnati-based DomiRacer who had
  purchased the contents of the Berliner warehouse when the company closed in
  '84. Bob sold it to collector Hiroaki Iwashita for $17,000.00 a princely sum
  in 1987. In 2000 the Ducati Museum in Bologna acquired the prototype and
  restored it in 2001.  ref:http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/apollo
