  I love a good engine cutaway and this 1951 Vincent HRD is amazing. Philip
  Vincent had built a motorcycle of his own in 1927 and in 1928 had registered a
  patent for a cantilever rear suspension of his own design. He was advised to
  start production under an established name so with the backing of his family
  wealth from cattle ranching in Argentina, Vincent acquired the trademark,
  goodwill and remaining components of HRD in 1928 for $706 dollars in 1928! The
  company was promptly renamed Vincent HRD Co., Ltd and production moved to
  Stevenage.

I love a good engine cutaway and this 1951 Vincent HRD is amazing. Philip Vincent had built a motorcycle of his own in 1927 and in 1928 had registered a patent for a cantilever rear suspension of his own design. He was advised to start production under an established name so with the backing of his family wealth from cattle ranching in Argentina, Vincent acquired the trademark, goodwill and remaining components of HRD in 1928 for $706 dollars in 1928! The company was promptly renamed Vincent HRD Co., Ltd and production moved to Stevenage.

This Vincent cutaway is part of the Science Museum in London's collection of objects and is part of a planned exhibition called 'Biker Tribes".
