  In the spring of 1921 Harley-Davidson and Indian were in a battle to become
  the first to attain 100mph in England. Bert Le Vack had joined the Hendee
  Manufacturing team in late 1920 and was keen to take the record. Le Vack
  helped Indian sort out the eight valve Powerplus engine and despite being a
  1912 Charles Franklin design he was able to make an unofficial run of 103 mph
  at Brooklands on alcohol based fuel. Harley-Davidson failed at their first
  attempt and Indian was in a position grab the record with a officially timed
  run. But during the timed run a cam follower broke destroying the timing case
  taking a pushrod with it. Burt and the Indian crew worked through the night to
  repair the engine but the following day the timekeepers were unavailable
  thanks to a misunderstanding and before another run could be rescheduled
  Harley-Davidson had achieved the 100 mph record. Le Vack was very upset but
  the following day the timekeepers were ready and Bert raised the one-way
  kilometre record to 106.65 mph and later to 107.55 on officially timed runs.
  Bert was with Indian for four years but after the record attempts he reached
  out to John Prestwich at JAP in what some say was a renewed sense of
  patriotism in hopes of putting a British made big twin "Yank-Buster" back on
  the throne. ref:http://www.geocities.ws/charles_b_franklin/contents.html
