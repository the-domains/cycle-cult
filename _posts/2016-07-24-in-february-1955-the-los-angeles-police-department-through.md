  In February 1955, the Los Angeles Police Department, through the pages of the
  internally produced BEAT magazine, conducted a contest for a motto for the
  police academy. The conditions of the contest stated that: "The motto should
  be one that in a few words would express some or all the ideals to which the
  Los Angeles police service is dedicated. It is possible that the winning motto
  might someday be adopted as the official motto of the Department." The winning
  entry was the motto, "To Protect and to Serve" submitted by Officer Joseph S.
  Dorobek.
