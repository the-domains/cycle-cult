  Jack Marshall (photographed here at Brooklands) won the 1908 Isle of Man TTâ€™s
  single-cylinder class on a 3 1/2 hp Triumph having finished second in the
  inaugural race the year before behind Charlie Collier and his Matchless.
  Triumph riders Jack Marshall and Freddie Hulbert had placed second and third
  in the first motorcycle TT race. In fact Marshall protested Collier's win
  claiming that his Triumph had the fastest time when stops for repairs were
  deducted. Pedal gears were prohibited and the fuel regulations were changed
  for the 1908 TT. Singles were restricted to 100 miles to the gallon and twins
  to 80 miles. Triumph's reputation for quality and dependability were becoming
  well-established and Jack's TT win in 1908 boosted sales considerably. In the
  previous years TT race, most entries were single cylinder machines but for
  1908 over half the entries were twin and multi cylinder machines such as the 4
  cylinder Belgian F.N. Single and multi cylinder machines were decided into
  separate classes for 1908. Marshall grabbed an early led of the singles, but
  lost it to Charlie Collier when he crashed at Kirk Michael on the first lap.
  Jack lost even more ground when he stopped to change a broken exhaust valve
  and mend a tire puncture. His rival Charlie Collier was having his own
  problems and having stopped to change a sparkplug. Harry Reed was leading the
  multi cylinder class on a Peugeot-engined DOT. Late in the race in front of
  the 2,000 spectators at St. John's, Jack Marshall overtook the lead from
  Collier winning the race by two minutes. Jack's average speed was 40.49 mph
  Harry Reed won the multi cylinder class but the average speed of the winning
  twin was slower than that of the Jack's Triumph single. The win stimulated
  sales with around Triumph 3,000 motorcycles being produced in 1909. Triumph's
  reputation was such that at the onset of WW1 in 1914 the British army placed
  an order for 30,000 motorcycles for the war effort.
