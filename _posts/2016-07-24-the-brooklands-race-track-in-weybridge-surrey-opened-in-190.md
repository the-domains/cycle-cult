  The Brooklands race track in Weybridge, Surrey opened in 1907 and is often
  called the 'birth place of British motor-sport'. A railway engineer designed
  the banked curves to allow speeds up to 90mph but by the 1930's racers were
  reaching speeds well over 130mph. It was 100ft wide and the length was three
  and a quarter miles, of which two miles were level. The banking on one end was
  25ft 8" inches high and the opposite end was 28ft 8" inches high. The surface
  was built of gravel and Portland concrete, not the new and prohibitively
  expensive asphalt and as such was very bumpy. More than a 1,000 men were
  involved in the construction financed by Hugh and Ethel Locke King. The
  Brooklands Automobile Racing Club (BARC) was formed in December 1906 a month
  before the track was completed. By January of 1907 Hugh Locke King has a
  nervous breakdown and was close to bankruptcy from cost over runs, Ethel took
  over control and was able to raise more funds from family and friends. Prior
  to a race groups of workers with ropes tied around their waists to keep them
  from falling down the steep banking, would sweep the surface with brooms by
  hand. On June 29th 1907 Selwyn Edge established a 24 hour solo record
  traveling 1,500 miles at an average speed of 65mph with a few brief rests in
  between. The constant noise created by the record event annoyed the neighbors
  so much that no more 24 hour attempts were allowed, unless completed in two 12
  hour daylight stints, which would become known as the 'Double 12'.
