  Guy Lee Evans was already a fast competitor at Brooklands in 1909 when Billy
  Wells of the Hendee Mfg. Co.'s London depot offered him an Indian Motorcycle
  to ride. Evans repaid the favor by becoming the first American to win a
  motorcycle race at Brooklands with speed of 64.7 mph in his class (750cc).
  Evans's 638cc v-twin also won the senior handicap for 1000cc machines! Billy
  Wells was also a racerhaving competed in the inaugural 1907 Isle of Man TT
  race. For the 1909 Isle of Man races Billy Wells convinced Hendee to support
  Gordon Fletcher, Guy Lee Evans and himself as riders for the Senior TT. Wells
  injured himself during practice the day before the race and although he
  started on race day, he was forced to retire after completing only a couple
  laps due to pain from his injuries. Guy Lee Evans used his two-speed all-chain
  drive V-twin to great advantage over the belt drive competition, holding the
  lead for half the race, finishing just a minute or two behind Harry Collierâ€™s
  Matchless to take second. The next year Indian's chief designer Oscar Hedstrom
  came to observe the TT for Hendee. The Indian works team for 1910 was Guy Lee
  Evans, Charlie Bennett and Walter Bentley (yeah that Bentley) and Indian
  supported privateers Arthur Moorhouse, Jimmy Alexander and Charles B.
  Franklin. But luck was against the boys when a batch of Indian supplied inner
  tubes proved faulty, with several riders crashing due to tire blowouts.
  Indian's best finishes in 1910 were Jimmy Alexander 14th and Guy Lee Evans
  21st. Matchless and the Collier brothers were again on the podium with Charlie
  Collier taking first with an average speed of 50.63 mph and his brother Harry
  close behind in second place. Later that year Charlie Bennett would win the
  Brooklands 60-Lap TT race on an Indian motorcycle with an average speed of 61
  mph. ref: Motorcycle Illustrated Sept. 1, 1909
