  This is one of my favorite Isle of Man photos, George Rowley on the AJS V4
  Kompressor at the 1936 senior TT. Motorcycle design just prior to WW2 was
  advancing at a staggering pace with all kinds of unusual and revolutionary
  engine layouts being developed. Collier & Sons launched their AJS 500cc V-4 at
  the Olympia Motor Cycle Show in London in 1935. Designed by Bert Collier, the
  AJS design was similar to another V-4 Collier engine design, the 1931 593cc
  Matchless 'Silver Hawk'. The AJS V-4 was technologically advanced 500cc 50ยบ
  chain-driven SOHC engine, with exposed 'hairpin' valve springs. Although it
  debuted at the Olympia show as a tourer the machine never went into production
  and only a few bikes were built. In the spring of 1936 AJS began testing a new
  racing version of the V-4 at Brooklands. The new machine now had alloy barrels
  and sported a supercharger designed by Swiss engineer Arnold Zoller. The
  supercharged V4 produced 55hp and had a top speed of 135mph, it was designed
  to compete against BMW's Kompressor machines. BMW had been developing
  supercharged racers for sometime, starting in 1929 with Ernest Henne's 134.6
  mph land speed record. The AJS V-4's supercharger was mounted in the front and
  was driven at half engine speed, and fed by a single Amal TT carburetor. The
  engine was mounted in the same frame as the 500 cc OHC single TT racers, and
  used a four-speed Burman gearbox with a dry clutch. Harold Daniell and George
  Rowley rode the AJS supercharged V4s in the Isle of Man Senior TT, but despite
  its high top speed, it was heavy, and did not handle well. The bikes were also
  plagued with carbonation troubles and lacked acceleration. Both riders retired
  due to mechanical problems. Single cylinder machines would again dominate the
  TT with Freddie Firth winning on his Norton with a record speed. AJS would
  continue to develop the V-4 turning to liquid cooling in 1939 utilizing a cast
  alloy engine with enclosed valve springs. Between 1936 and 1939, the AJS V-4
  set several records, breaking the 100 mph lap speed record at the Ulster Grand
  Prix.
