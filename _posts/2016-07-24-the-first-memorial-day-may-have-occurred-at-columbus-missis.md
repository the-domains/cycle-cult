  The first Memorial Day may have occurred at Columbus, Mississippi in 1866 when
  four women gathered together to decorate the graves of the Confederate
  soldiers. Columbus was near a rail line and received Confederate casualties of
  war. By the end of the war 2,500 Confederate soldiers are thought to have been
  buried in Friendship Cemetery along with, 32 Union soldiers. The women felt
  moved to honor the Union soldiers buried there by decorating their graves as
  well. A Yale graduate and poet Francis Miles Finch, heard about the gesture of
  humanity and reconciliation by the women of Columbus and wrote a tribute poem
  to soldiers from both sides. The poem called "The Blue and the Gray" was
  published in the September, 1867 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. In 1868, the
  Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans established
  "Decoration Day" as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war
  dead with flowers. By the 20th century, Union and Confederate holiday
  traditions which were celebrated on different days, merged to become "Memorial
  Day" to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. An
  American flag is placed on each of their graves in national cemeteries by
  volunteers on the last Monday of May. Remember those who gave the ultimate
  sacrifice for our freedom.
