  The Benelli 250cc four cylinder GP bike made its racing debut in 1962. Silvio
  Grassetti made his Grand Prix debut as a Benelli factory rider in 1959 and is
  photographed here in 1962 with the Benelli 250/4 which he rode in several
  Italian competitions while the bike was still under development. It had a dry
  sump engine with vertical cylinders and double-overhead camshafts with two
  valves per cylinder. The prototype weighted just 268lbs dry and produced 40bhp
  at 13,000rpm! Tarquinio Provini joined the Benelli works team in 1964 and
  brought Benelli it's first victory with the 250/4 at the Spanish Montjuic
  circuit, his first race with the team. Provini placed fifth in the 1964 the
  world cup. In 1965 riding a 350cc (a bored out 250cc/4), Provini won the Grand
  Prix of Italy at Monza. 1966 was looking good for Benelli until tragically,
  Provini suffered a serious crash at the Isle of Man TT in practice that broke
  his back in 5 places. Tarquinio Provini had 20 GP victories between 1954 and
  â€™65, six in 125 and 14 in 250, as well as 13 Italian championships and four
  Isle of Man TTs. Benelli hired Aermacchi rider Renzo Pasolini for 1967. In
  1968 Pasolini won the Italian title and came in second at the TT on the 250/4.
  At the start of the 1969 season Pasolini crashed at Hockenheim and missed 2 GP
  races and the IOM TT. Kel Carruthers and Phil Read were enlisted by Benelli to
  race the TT and Carruthers won the TT. Carruthers became a Benelli works rider
  and Pasolini returned winning the Dutch GP on the 250/4. The FIM changed the
  rules in 1970 limiting the 250 class to two cylinders and six gears making the
  250/4 obsolete.
