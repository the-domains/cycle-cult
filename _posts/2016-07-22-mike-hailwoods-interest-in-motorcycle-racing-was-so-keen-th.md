  Mike Hailwood's interest in motorcycle racing was so keen that he dropped out
  of school at sixteen to work on the assembly line at the Triumph factory in
  Meriden. Stan Hailwood was able to supply his son with the best racing
  equipment available through his dealership, but Mike insisted on paying back
  his father for every cent spent on racing. By the end of his first full season
  of club racing, Mike was British Champion. He won his first World Championship
  in 1961. In 1964 prior to the US Grand Prix in Daytona Stan Hailwood rented
  the Daytona Speedway and got MV Agusta to lend them a spare 500cc works
  motorcycle for a go at the world one-hour speed record. Bob McIntyre held the
  current record of 141 mph (227 km/h), which he set in 1957 on a Gilera 350cc
  at the extremely bumpy Monza track. Hailwood broke the Bob's record with an
  average speed of 144.8 mph and went on to win the US GP later that same week!
