  The NSU RK 350 ("Renn Kompressor") and RK 500 had two cylinders and dual
  overhead camshafts . Each had its own camshaft bevel for the drive. Engine
  development was started in 1938, DKW was unbeatable in the 250 class with
  their ULD 250 a supercharged dual-piston two-stroke and even Moto Guzzi ,
  Norton and Gilera were becoming stronger. Walter Moore ex-Norton engineer and
  Albert Roder who came to NSU in 1936 from Zundapp designed the engine with
  Moore as the chief engineer. NSU had high hopes for the 350cc compressor
  design especially after Heiner Fleischmann beat DKW's Ewald Kluge and Walfried
  Winkler but the machine was heavy and proved unreliable. In the 1939 Senior
  TT, Wilhelm Herz would pilot a 500cc machine and two 350cc compressor racers
  were deployed in the 350cc Junior. None of the NSU's reached the finish line.
  Wilhelm Herz fell in the second round. It was a unbearable debacle for Moore
  and the NSU team.
