  This is a great shot of the NSU works team in 1938. Karl Bodmer is on the
  double knocker twin cam 350cc single in the foreground and two NSU RK 350 twin
  compressor machines are just in front of him, ridden by Wilhelm Herz and Otto
  Rührschneck. The third bike in the photo is DKW's SS 350 a supercharged twin
  cylinder two-stroke. Earlier versions of the DKW machine had two different
  induction systems, the ULd featured a rotary valve while the ULe used a reed
  valve. A quick scan of the crowd reveals how dominate the Nazi presence was at
  sporting events in Germany just prior to the war. Karl Bodmer was a driving
  instructor for the NSKK (Nationalsozialistische Kraftfahrkorps) from 1940 to
  1943 until being shipped off to Russia as a Panzer Division tank commander.
  After the war in 1946 Bodmer with a few comrades organized and participated in
  the first post war race in Germany. In 1947 he competed at Schauinsland and
  several other regional races on his prewar NSU bevel drive single before
  hanging up his helmet for health reasons. He devoted himself to family and
  opened a motorcycle and micro car dealership selling NSU, BMW, HOREX,
  VICTORIA, DKW, Vespa scooter and BMW Isetta, GUTBROD and Lloyd small cars.
