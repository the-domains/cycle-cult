  The classic battle between Giacomo Agostini and "Mike the Bike" Hailwood. Ago
  won 10 Isle of Man TTs and Hailwood was winner 14 times at the TT. It would be
  Agostini who in 1972 having lost so many friends at the Isle of Man, put up
  his hands and said that the circuit was too dangerous. In 1977 the race was
  removed from the World Championship calendar. Racing in the 1960s and 1970s
  was a very dangerous sport, the concern for safety was not like it is today so
  the possibility of dying at the track was very real. Agostini had an
  incredible 122 Grand Prix wins in his career. Mike Hailwood was a nine-time
  World Champion, and winner of 76 career Grand Prixs. Mike even came out of
  retirement after an 11-year absence and, against all odds, won the Isle of Man
  in 1978. Yeah I'd say any battle on the track between these titans of two
  wheels is going to be classic.
