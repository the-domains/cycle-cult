  Ultra-lightweight motorcycles have always piqued my interest and the Motom
  marque crafted a handsome machine. A lot of engineers in post WWII Italy were
  looking to design exceptionally fuel efficient transportation. Battista
  Falchetto an ex Lancia engineer, introduced his first little motorbike at the
  Geneva Motor Show in 1947. The Motomic or Atomic Moto had an innovative
  lightweight pressed sheet metal frame sporting a 50cc single-cylinder 4-stroke
  engine, with incredible performance and low fuel consumption. The Motom was an
  instant success and Falchetto began designing more small machines for the
  market. In 1950, the Motom Dolphin was introduced with a 147cc single cylinder
  engine that was tilted forward with over head valves and a four-speed
  transmission. In 1953, a third model, the Motion Touring 98 was introduced
  with a frame formed by a central truss presses sheet metal that incorporated
  the gas tank. Many unique designs would follow, Motom manufactured motorcycles
  and mopeds in Milano, Italy, from 1945 to 1971. The little racer pictured here
  was a 1962 prototype with a horizontal cylinder layout and a sweet 98cc OHC
  four stroke 2-valve unit construction engine.
