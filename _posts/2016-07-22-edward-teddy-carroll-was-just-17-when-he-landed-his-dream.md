  Edward "Teddy" Carroll was just 17 when he landed his dream job in 1914 as a
  test rider for Indian Motorcycles at the Hendee factory in Springfield,
  Massachusetts. In April of 1915, the factory furnished Teddy with an 8-valve
  racer for the Readville, Massachusetts races and he won his first professional
  race beating the H-D "wrecking crew's" Al Stratton and Irving Janke, and
  setting a new track record. Always a top contender Carroll came in 2nd at the
  300-mile Chicago board track event and also came in 2nd at the 100-mile race
  in Milwaukee that same year. Teddy made headlines on August 16th 1917 at the
  Cincinnati Motor Speedway by setting the World's 12-hour, 24-hour, 500-mile
  and 1000-mile records for a motorcycle with a sidecar. With George Von Straden
  of Indianapolis in the chair, the standard Indian sidecar was used with the
  only alterations being that the springs were removed and the body dropped
  lower in the chassis. Von Stridden lay low as possible and worked a hand pump
  to keep gas feeding into the main fuel tank. The Indian captured the 500-mile
  record in less than 10 hours with an average speed of 56.1 miles an hour
  besting "Red" Parkhurst's record by 51 minutes. At the 12 hour mark they had
  covered 661 and a half miles breaking the old record by 47 and a half miles
  even after stopping to replace a fuel line and change a tire. Enduring several
  hours of rain the boys broke Parkhurst's 1000-mile record with a time of
  18:48:30 shaving an hour and a half of the record. The Indian Power Plus hit
  the 24 hour mark with 1,275 miles under their belt. In 1919 it looked like
  Teddy might win the Marion, Indiana "Cornfield Classic" when he over took Otto
  Walker in the final laps. But Carroll was forced to stop and replace a broken
  exhaust valve spring which he accomplished in 2 minutes and 38 seconds on the
  39th lap, but he would have to settle for 4th place behind the Harley riders
  Red Parkhurst 1st, Ralph Hepburn 2nd, and Otto Walker in 3rd.
