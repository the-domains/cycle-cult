  In May of 1952 a pair of Vincent Black Shadows were prepared for a 24-Hour
  speed record attempt at the Montlhéry autodrome just south of Paris. The fuel
  tank held enough gas for an hour and a half at the flat out speed reached on
  the banking. There were four riders that would rotate every hour and a half in
  the saddle. In this photo Vic Willoughby is standing behind the bike waiting
  his turn to ride. In Vic's own words "I tucked my elbows in and got my chin
  down. Took a look at the speedo on the straight: showed a hundred and thirty.
  Around the banking." But things would soon go south for Vic and the Shadow "
  I'm going round and round, everything going nicely, getting the thumbs-up -
  that was about the only signal from the pits - when all of a sudden, on the
  banking at just over a hundred and twenty mph, the bike locked solid as could
  be and i just got the clutch out, weaving all over the bloody place. Jesus, my
  heart was in my mouth as I pulled in!" The roller big end had seized up on the
  bike and Vincent's hopes of breaking the record were dashed. The Montlhéry
  Shadows were promoted as production roadsters rather than racing specials and
  as such used the standard bearings, had the factory used caged roller bearing
  big ends made by Alpha like George Brown used in his "Nero" and "Super Nero"
  sprinters the results might have been different. Vincent still ended up going
  home from France with eight other speed records.
