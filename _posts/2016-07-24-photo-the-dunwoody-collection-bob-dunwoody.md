  Days Trial (ISDT) and he was European champion twice! Since 1964 Sammy and his
  wife Rosemary have operated the Sammy Miller motor museum in New Milton. There

  and prototypes. Included in the collection are an original sterile AJS E90
  Porcupine, Geoff Duke's Gilera 500 4C and a Verdel with a radial engine. Sammy
