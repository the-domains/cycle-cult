  Jimmie Guthrie became one of Joe Craig's Norton works riders in 1931 and the
  Norton team became almost unbeatable. At the 1931 Senior TT, Norton would win
  the first three positions. Tim Hunt won the Senior while Guthrie who had
  slid-off at the Governor's Bridge on lap 5, finished in 2nd place at an
  average speed of 77.34 mph (124.47 km/h). Fellow Norton team-mate Stanley
  Woods finished in 3rd place with a glove stuffed in the fuel tank filler,
  having lost the cap on the course. At the 1932 TT it was Norton again with
  Stanley Woods, Jimmie Guthrie, and Jimmie Simpson in first second and third
  place finishes in the senior. Norton continued to dominate the Senior TT in
  1933 with Woods, Simpson, Hunt and Guthrie taking the top 4 positions in that
  order. Jimmie Guthrie would win the 1934 Senior and Junior TT for Norton with
  team-mate Jimmie Simpson coming in second in both races as well. Stanley Woods
  had left Norton in 1934 to race for Husqvarna and moved to Moto Guzzi in 1935
  winning the Senior TT for the Italians with Guthrie, Walter Rusk and John
  Duncan taking second, third and forth for Norton. Woods won the 1935 Senior TT
  Race by 4 seconds from Jimmie Guthrie in 3 hours, 7 minutes and 10 seconds at
  an average speed of 84.68 mph (136.28 km/h). This photo is Jimmie Guthrie
  after winning the 1936 Senior TT. Moto Guzzi was involved in war production
  for the crisis in Abyssinia, so Stanley Woods rode for Velocette in the 1936
  taking second place in the Senior with Freddie Frith riding for Norton coming
  in third. Freddie would win the 1937 Senior for Norton and Jimmie Guthrie
  would win the Junior. Jimmie Guthrie, was killed during the German Grand Prix
  later that year.
