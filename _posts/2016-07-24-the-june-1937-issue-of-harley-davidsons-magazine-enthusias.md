  The June 1937 issue of Harley-Davidson's magazine 'Enthusiast' features a
  great photo of some "Hare Scrambles". At first glance the spectators in the
  upper right looked like leaves on a tree branch to me. I then noticed the
  course chalk outlines in the upper left and dispensed with the idea that it
  was a hill climb event. Scrambles, you say? Yeah, before Motocross and
  fundamentally different thanTrials competitions, Scrambles were off-road races
  around a marked course over rough terrain. The overall winner is the rider who
  maintains the highest speed throughout the race, unlike Trials where delicate
  balancing and strict scoring are the measure of excellence. We can probably
  thank scrambles for early developments in suspension and the rear swing arm. I
  can only imagine what running a Scramble on a rigid frame motorcycle does to a
  man. The Honda CL77 or Scrambler 305 was the off-road or scrambler version of
  the Honda C77 Dream and the CB77 Super Hawk of the 1960s.
