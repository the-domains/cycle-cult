  The Velocette overhead camshaft KTT's were one of the most successful
  production racing motorcycles of all time. Check out this rendering of the
  1937 TT Works Velocette race engine. The TT designation indicated the machine
  was intended for racing and it was in production from 1928 until 1950. Major
  changes to the design were designated as Mk1 thru Mk8 although not all marks
  were used. Despite being a design dating to 1928 it was good enough for
  Freddie Frith and Velocette to win the 350cc World Championship in 1949 on a
  works twin-cam engine. Based on the Velocette KSS, the KTT was developed as a
  production racer specifically for the Isle of Man TT course, which was the
  most important road race in the world at the time. A racing version of the
  Model K was built by Percy and Eugene Goodman, sons of the Velocette founder
  Johannes Gutgemann, in 1925 and after twelve months of development Velocette
  secured their first TT win in 1926. Alec Bennett was the winner with Gus Kuhn
  and Fred Povey finishing in the first nine to give the factory the team prize.
