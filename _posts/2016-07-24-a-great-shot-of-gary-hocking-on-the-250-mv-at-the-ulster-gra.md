  A great shot of Gary Hocking on the 250 MV at the Ulster Grand Prix in 1960.
  In the spring of 1960 Gary campaigned a private Norton at the races in South
  Africa and won the South African Championship in the 500cc class. MV Agusta
  offered Hocking full factory support for the 1960 season riding in the 125,
  250 and 350cc classes for the World Cup and he repaid them by finishing 2nd in
  all three classes. At the 1960 Isle of Man Gary was the winner of the five-lap
  Lightweight race, leading throughout in front of another all-Italian battle
  between Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio Provini. In 1961, Hocking became MV
  Agusta's top rider and went on to claim dual World Championships in the 350cc
  and 500cc classes. At the 1962 Isle of Man Hocking slammed into the back of
  another Rhodesian, Graham Smith, at about 120 mph on a bend during practice.
  Hocking's MV burst into flames, but he was thrown clear, escaping with cuts
  and bruises, while Smith suffered a fractured hip. A TT official who witnessed
  the crash said "It is incredible both riders are alive." A crash like that
  would have deterred a lesser man from competing and in fact as he wheeled his
  MV to the start of the Senior TT, Gary left behind a promise to his parents
  that, win or lose, this would be his last race. On the second of the six laps,
  Hocking gave an incredible display of cornering and opened a fifteen-second
  gap on Hailwood, shattering the lap record of 105,75 mph in the process. He
  took the checkered flag, covering the 226,4 miles in 2 hr. 11 min. 14 sec. at
  a record average speed of 103,51 mph. Hocking kept his word, and after his
  Senior TT success, announced his retirement. Unfortunately just six months
  later he died at the age of twenty-five in an ambulance on the way to
  Addington Hospital, after crashing his Lotus Climax V8 car at Westmead,
  Durban, while practicing for the Natal Grand Prix.
