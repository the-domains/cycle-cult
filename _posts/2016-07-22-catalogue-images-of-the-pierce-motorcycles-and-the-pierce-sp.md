  Catalogue images of the Pierce motorcycles and the Pierce special racer
  bicycle similar to the one Frank Louis Kramer raced. Kramer won national
  amateur titles in his second and third year of racing. He won the national
  championship in 1901 and raced successfully in Europe in 1905 and 1906,
  winning thirty-one races out of forty-three starts. In 1912 Kramer won the
  world professional sprint championship at the Newark Velodrome. Frank Kramer
  won 16 consecutive national championships from 1901 to 1916. His amazing
  string of championships was broken in 1917, but, he regained the championship
  twice in 1918 and finally in 1921 at the age of 41. He retired from racing on
  July 25, 1922 at the age of 42, after remarking that "...racing as too
  strenuous for one of his age and expressed the belief that to continue would
  impair his health in later years".
