  In 1922 Selwyn Edge returned to Brooklands with Gwenda Jason for a historic
  simultaneous attempt at the automobile and motorcycle 'Double 12' (two 12 hour
  stints) world record. Gwenda was the only daughter of Major-General Sir
  Frederick Glubb, she is shown here on her 250cc Trump-JAP motorcycle. Selwyn
  Edge's auto was a 5.7 litre Spyker and he averaged 75 mph breaking thirty
  records for the combined 24 hour run. Edge brushed off the the achievements as
  a "holiday". Gwenda established the first 'Double 12' on a motorcycle with an
  average speed of just under 45 mph. She remarked afterward that she was
  "sustained, by tea and cigarettes". Gwenda was married to Colonel Janson the
  director of the Spyker car company, but the marriage wouldn't last long and
  she soon married Colonel Neil Stewart. She then went to the track at
  Montlhéry, France and established a new 24 hour word record with a Tarrot-JAP
  motorcycle. While in France she had an affair with Douglas Hawkes one of the
  mechanics she worked with during her record attempt. She married Hawkes and he
  bought her a 2-litre a Miller Special race car which she proceeded to break
  the one mile/kilometre speed record at over 234km/h (145mph) on the oval at
  Montlhéry between 1930 and 1933. Gwenda raced in the Le Mans 24-Hours twice
  driving a Maserati engined Derby race car, but without great success. In 1940
  Gwenda and Douglas returned to England opening a mechanical engineering
  factory near Brooklands. Gwenda worked at making artillery shells for the
  duration of WWII.  ref: A Contemporary History of Women's Sport - By Jean
