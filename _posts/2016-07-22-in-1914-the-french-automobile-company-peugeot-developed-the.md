  In 1914 the French automobile company Peugeot developed the most technically
  advanced motorcycle engine to date, the first twin-cylinder double overhead
  cam engine with 4 valves per cylinder. The engineer responsible for this
  remarkable achievement was Ernest Henry and he was just 27 years old at the
  time he joined Peugeot in 1911. Henry had previously studied at the Applied
  Mechanics Technical in Geneva later working on marine and aviation engines for
  Picker of Geneva and Motos Labor Manufacturing in Paris. Peugeot was already a
  major player in auto racing with drivers Georges Billet, Paul Zuccarelli, and
  Jules Goux driving for the factory team. These men convinced Robert Peugeot
  that an engine with optimized engine airflow utilizing twin cams and more
  valves could create impressive power. Peugeot embraced their theories and
  tasked young Ernest Henry with developing the new engine with input from the
  drivers. The old guard technical staff at Peugeot considered the project a
  foolish pursuit and began to call the team "Les Charlatans". Henry started
  from a blank page in the racing department, working in secret with a budget
  allocated by the factory. In early 1912 the design was completed and featured
  four inclined valves for each of the four cylinders with a twin camshaft
  cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers. The 4 valves per
  cylinder were arranged in V, with 7.6 liter (L76 type) and 3 liter (3 type)
  restricted capacity engines being built. The new lighter car could reach
  120mph and won the 1912 French Grand Prix in both the unlimited and the
  three-liter restricted Coupe de l'Auto competition. In 1914 Henry designed a
  500cc parallel-twin engine for the Peugeot 500 M racing motorcycle, using two
  250cc cylinders from his auto engine design. It had a double overhead cam
  head, actuated by a cascade of gears and 4 valves per cylinder. The engine was
  very sophisticated for the time, however the head suffered from over heating
  issues attributed to the limited performance of metallurgy of the era, causing
  the cylinder heads to warp from excessive heat between the valve sockets. In
  1919 Marcel Grémillon did a major re-design of the engine. Henry's original
  design had exposed valve train gear drive mechanism between the two cylinders,
  later versions like the one shown moved the drive to the side of the
  cylinders. After WWI in 1923, Lessman Antonesco revised the design with a
  single camshaft and two valves per cylinder, dry clutch, kick start,
  three-speed transmission and front brakes, it produced a claimed 27 hp.
