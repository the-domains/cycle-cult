  Between 1969 and 1977 Ángel Nieto won six of the nine 50cc titles, losing only
  two titles. The Dutchman Jan DeVries riding a Van Veen - Kreidler was one of
  his main rivals. For the 1971 season Van Veen developed a new Grand Prix 50cc
  racer with a Jorg Moller designed Kreidler two-stroke engine. The 50cc GP
  heats up with Kreidler also supporting racers Barry Sheene and Jarno Saarinen
  and Derbi adding Gilberto Parlotti for 1971. At the end of the season in the
  50cc GP it was Jan DeVries in first and Nieto in second place but Nieto wins
  the 125cc championship. Ángel Nieto also competed in the 250cc GP as shown in
  this photo on a Derbi twin cylinder two-stroke. Börje Jansson was the only
  rider to win a GP riding the idiosyncratic Derbi 250 twin, at the 1972
  Austrian GP at (Saltzburgring).
