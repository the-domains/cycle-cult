  1960 was the first year that the Honda team would compete in an entire
  season's racing. Australian racers Tom Phillis and Bob Brown were added to the
  Honda works team to help them with technical feedback in February of 1960. In
  1959 with two previous years experience racing the Continental Circus, Phillis
  a privateer had won three international 500cc victories on his Norton. Bob
  Brown had finished in third place in both the 350cc and 500cc world
  championships. Honda returned to the Isle of Man in 1960 with revised 125
  twins (RC143) and 16-valve (RC161) 250 fours. Phillis' machine suffered from
  misfiring during the 250 TT, but Brown finished fourth, becoming the first
  Westerner to score world championship points on a Japanese machine. Brown's
  average speed of 89.21mph was a good 4mph behind race winner Carlo Ubbiali's
  MV Agusta on the 37 3/4 mile mountain course. Luigi Taveri (shown here) became
  frustrated with MV Agusta, where Ubbiali was the favored 125/250 rider and
  planned to retire from racing at the end of 1960. But his wife Tilde
  approached Honda on his behalf and he became a Honda works rider in 1961.
