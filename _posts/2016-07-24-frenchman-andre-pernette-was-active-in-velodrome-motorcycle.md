  Frenchman, André Pernette was active in velodrome motorcycle racing in the
  early 1900's. Pernette set the hour record for motorbikes of less than 50
  kilos with a1/3 litre Peugeot Racer in 1906. The Alcyon Buchet direct-belt
  drive twin ran a speed of 94.73 km/h or 3 km/h faster than the previously held
  by record by Giuppone also on a Peugeot. Later that year on October 8th at a
  Velodrome in Buffalo, New York he was involved in a major crash. The belt on
  Pernette's motorcycle slipped off locking up his back wheel and throwing him
  off. This caused his opponent Constant Ceurremans to crash into spectators who
  were leaning over the barrier resulting in 2 people dead and 10 injured, both
  riders survived.
