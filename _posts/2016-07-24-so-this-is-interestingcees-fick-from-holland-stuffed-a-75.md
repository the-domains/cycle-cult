  So this is interesting...Cees Fick from Holland stuffed a 750 Harley-Davidson
  WLA surplus WWII engine in a Norton featherbed frame and transplanted
  Matchless cylinder heads on the beast! Cees was apparently quite well known as
  a Vincent builder in the Netherlands and he built several of these WLD
  Matchless engines in the 70's. Some of the engines ended up in sport bikes and
  others in choppers ofthat era. He had a factory in Tilburg and in his spare
  time experimented building frames of his own design and mashing up engine
  components like a Noriel ( an Ariel 4 in a featherbed Norton frame) and this
  creation.  ref: photo Anibal Martinez via Antique Motorcycle Club of America's
