  Walter William Moore designed Norton's first overhead cam engine the CS1. The
  engine was originally built as a 500 cc TT racer for the Norton works team in
  1927 and it was used in a road bike the following year, sharing the same frame
  and cycle parts as the pushrod ES2. Alec Bennett riding the CS1 on its first
  race won the Isle of Man Senior TT in 1927 and Stanley Woods set the fastest
  lap at 70.99 mph before retiring. In 1929, NSU hired Walter Moore away from
  Norton and he brought his drawings of Norton engines with him. The 1930 NSU SS
  500 and 350 had all the characteristics of a Norton, so much so that the
  British began saying NSU actually stood for "Norton Spares Used." The SS 500
  was an air-cooled transverse single cylinder overhead valve with a single
  bevel driven overhead camshaft. The bore was 80 mm and stroke 99 mm and could
  deliver 28 hp at 5,500 rpm. In 1937 Moore designed a twin overhead-cam 500cc
  and 350cc engine for the NSU works team of Heiner Fleischmann, Karl Bodmer and
  Werner Mellman. This photo is Karl Bodmer's 351 SSR and is the only surviving
  example, restored by German NSU specialist Karl Reese. The NSU 350 DOCH made
  31hp at 7,000 rpm the 500 twin-cam version made 36hp at 6,000rpm.
