  The classic Harley-Davidson WLA or "Liberator" as it became known, was the
  main motorcycle used by the U.S. armed forces in WWII. In 1939 the Army was
  looking for a motorcycle better suited for military use than the standard
  civilian models. Harley-Davidson, Indian and even the Delco division of
  General Motors competed to develop motorcycles that had better ground
  clearance and off-road mobility and could carry a fully equipped soldier in
  adverse conditions. The Armyâ€™s use of motorcycles dated back to the First
  World War, when it acquired over 20,000 Harley-Davidsons and Indians to be
  used by messengers, military police engaged in traffic control, and for
  general purpose transportation. By 1940 the Army was considering using
  motorcycles as reconnaissance vehicles in the mechanized cavalry and was
  conducting field tests. But truth be told, motorcycles were extremely
  vulnerable on the battlefield and performed poorly off road. By 1943 most WLAs
  were replaced by Jeeps with the exception of police and dispatch riders who
  had less need to carry heavy loads of weapons and ammunition. Harley-Davidson
  produced a total of 57,565 WLAs during WWII of which 60 percent went to Allied
  forces as part of a Lend-Lease military assistance program.
