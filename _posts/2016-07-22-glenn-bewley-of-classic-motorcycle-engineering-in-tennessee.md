  Glenn Bewley of Classic Motorcycle Engineering in Tennessee brought this
  interesting 1949 Vincent Series C Black Shadow to the Barber Vintage Festival.
  It appears to be in "as found" condition having been discovered in
  Philadelphia after languishing hidden for more than a half century. It sports
  many period racing modifications including a conversion utilizing two front
  heads with twin Amal 32mm 10TT9 carbs! The exhaust pipes are Lighting 2" speck
  and it has the Lucas KVFTT racing magneto and 9:1 Specialloid pistons. The
  bike is said to have awoken from it's long slumber with the aid of some
  starting rollers and within minutes settled into a comfortable idle.
