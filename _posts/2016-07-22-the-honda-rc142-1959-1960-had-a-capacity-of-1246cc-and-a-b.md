  The Honda RC142 1959-1960, had a capacity of 124.6cc and a bore and stroke of
  44x41mm with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. The engine developed 18.5bhp at
  13000rpm and a weight of 87kg. Soichiro Honda wanted to compete in the Isle of
  Man TT races and by 1954 he had developed a single cylinder prototype race
  bike. He attended the TT as a spectator that year and realised that the
  competition was tougher than expected and his prototype wasn't up to the job
  so he went shopping. While in europe he bought all kinds of racing components
  and stuffed his suitcases with what he had aquired. With careful examination
  of these components and a couple years of new development on completely
  redesigned over head cam twin cylinder machines he was finally ready to take
  on the world and entered his RC142 machines in the 1959 Isle of Man TT. The
  twin cylinder engines were four stroke with the cylinders inclined forward 6
  degrees with a DOHC, driven by a vertical shaft with bevel gears. During
  practice for the TT it was obvious that the engines were under powered so
  four-valve heads which had been in development back in Japan were flown in
  prior to the race. But while reliable, on the TT course the bike still weren't
  fast enough to beat the european competition.
