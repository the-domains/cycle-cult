  On March 13, 1937, Joe Petrali set the land speed record for two-wheeled
  vehicles on a 4-valve 61 OHV with a speed of 136.183 miles per hour on the
  beach at Daytona, Florida. He rode a blue 1936 EL equipped with a 61 cubic
  inch Knucklehead engine that was specially designed for the attempt. It
  featured low-slung handlebars, and a fairing made from a cut and reshaped gas
  tank, also a rear tail finassembly was fitted for aerodynamics. The tail fin
  had to be removed for the official attempt, though, because it produced
  excessive vibration. Petrali won his 49th and final AMA national on August 29,
  1937 at the national hillclimb in Muskegon, Michigan. In 1937, the AMA
  introduced a new class called Class C which featured street-legal motorcycles
  in an effort to make motorcycle racing less expensive for ordinary
  motorcyclists. Petrali saw the change as rank amateurs taking to the track on
  heavy street bikes rather than a track full of seasoned pros like Class A
  racing. But manufacturers were cutting back on racing budgets during the Great
  Depression, spelling the end of Class A competition and, the Class C
  championship became the most important championship. Petraliâ€™s final race was
  at the Oakland 200 in November of 1938. It was his one and only Class C race.
  It was on an oiled-down one mile dirt track. Bikes were sliding everywhere and
  Petrali was almost hit several times. Smok'n Joe pulled off the track and hung
  up his leathers for good. The last great Class A champion walked away from
  racing.
