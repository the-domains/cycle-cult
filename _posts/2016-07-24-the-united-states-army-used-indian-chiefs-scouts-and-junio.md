  The United States Army used Indian Chiefs, Scouts, and Junior Scouts for
  various purposes in small numbers during WWII but none of these could unseat
  the Harley-Davidson WLA as the Army's main motorcycle. The early Indian Scout
  640 competed directly with Harley's WLA but the 750 cc (46 cu in) was too
  expensive and heavy. Indian's 500 cc (31 cu in) 741B shown in this 1942 photo
  was their best offering but it was underpowered and failed to gain a US
  Military contract for the company. Indian also offered a version based on the
  1,200 cc (73 cu in) Chief, the 344. Also approximately 1,056 copies of the
  841, an experimental motorcycle with a 750 cc motor mounted sideways in the
  frame with a shaft drive similar to a modern Moto Guzzi were also built but
  also failed to be adopted for wider military use. The Indian 841 was heavily
  inspired by the BMW R71 motorcycle, as was its competitor, the Harley-Davidson
  XA which was basically a copy.
