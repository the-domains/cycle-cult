  In post WWII England there were dozens of airfields being used for motorcycle
  and automotive racing including sprints. Thurleigh, Bedfordshire was
  originally a RAF base, it was handed over to the US 8th AF, 306th Bombardment
  Group known as 'The Reich wreckers' in September 1942. It was the first base
  in England to be handed over completely to the Americans allowing them
  sovereignty and full control over the area. The Group flew 341 daylight
  missions in B17 Flying Fortresses between October 1942 and April 1945 and were
  the first US Bomb group to fly a combat mission over Nazi Germany. Even now
  Thurleigh is home to FIA Formula 2 races. This is a photo of George Brown's
  "Nero" at Thurleigh airfield without it's streamlined fairing. George and
  Cliff Brown were early adopters of aerodynamics, finding benefits of up to
  20mph even in 1/4 mile sprints. In 1961 on a faired "Nero" George set the
  Standing Start Kilometre World Record for up to 1000cc machines with a run of
  20.505 seconds hitting the trap at 108.73 mph. Cliff Brown was able to sort
  out a misfire in the rear cylinder caused by trapped piston rings the night
  before Sunday's record attempt. George also set the British Standing Start
  Kilo Record in 250, 350 and 500cc classes on an Ariel Arrow special supplied
  to him by the Selly Oak company that same weekend!
