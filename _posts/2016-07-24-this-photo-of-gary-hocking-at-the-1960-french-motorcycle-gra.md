  This photo of Gary Hocking at the 1960 French motorcycle Grand Prix doesn't
  look like it is going to end well. Although clearly Gary was a resilient rider
  because he won the 350cc race at the Clermont-Ferrand circuit. Grand Prix
  motor racing originated in France and the French Grand Prix, open to
  international competition, is the oldest Grand Prix race, first run on 26 June
  1906 under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France in Sarthe, with a
  starting field of 32 automobiles. The Grand Prix name ("Great Prize") referred
  to the prize of 45,000 French francs to the race winner.
