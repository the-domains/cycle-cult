  Tazio Giorgio Nuvolari and his team mates with the Bianchi 348cc "Freccia
  Celeste" works machine circa 1926. The 350 Freccia Celeste was designed by
  Albino Baldi, Bianchi chief engineer and the double over head cam engine
  produced 23 hp at 5.000 rpm with a top speed of 87.5 mph (140 km/hr). Nuvolari
  is revered in Italy and indeed the world as one of the greatest prewar GP
  drivers. His victories include 72 major races (150 in all), 24 Grands Prix,
  five Coppa Cianos, two Mille Miglias, two Targa Florios, two RAC Tourist
  Trophies, a Le Mans 24-hour race, and a European Championship in Grand Prix
  racing. Ferdinand Porsche called him "the greatest driver of the past, the
  present, and the future"...wow! Nuvolari obtained his motorcycle license in
  1915 and started racing motorcycles in 1920 at the age of 27, winning the 1925
  350cc European Championship. He won the Nations Grand Prix four times between
  1925 and 1928, and the Lario Circuit race five times between 1925 and 1929,
  all in the 350cc class on a Bianchi Freccia Celeste motorcycle.
