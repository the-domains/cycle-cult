  Standing on the concrete at Brooklands on March 20th 1911, this forlorn
  looking racer is Oliver Cyril Godfrey. He is 23 years old and living with his
  mother in northwest London but his luck is about to change. Billy Wells of the
  Hendee Mfg Co.’s London branch has just received word that Oscar Hedstrom,
  Indian's big boss has entered five bikes in the 1911 Isle of Man TT races.
  Jake DeRosier, ArthurMoorhouse and Charles Franklin are the factory works
  riders but Indian also decided to support two privateers, Jake Alexander and
  Oliver. This isn't Indian's first TT, Indian rider Lee Evans finished second
  in 1909 and Jake Alexander managed to place 14th in 1910. But this year is
  different, 1911 will be the first year motorcycles are allowed to compete on
  the full 37.5-mile Mountain Course. In previous years motorcycles competed on
  an abbreviated circuit because they weren’t able to climb Snaefell Mountain.
  Most motorcycle of the day were still using direct-drive leather belts, with
  variable pulleys or planetary-geared hubs but the Indian's had a two-speed
  countershaft gearbox and chain final drive. The 1911 TT would also be the
  first year that limits on engine capacity were put in place now featuring new
  'Senior' and 'Junior' events. Senior machines were limited to a maximum of
  595cc (multis) and 500cc (singles) with Juniors permitted 340cc and 300cc
  respectively. Indian prepared a downsized variation of the standard 633cc
  'F-head' roadster engine specially for the TT which incorporated overhead
  inlet and side exhaust valves. Board track legend Jake DeRosier was the
  favorite to win but he crashed several times and was disqualified for
  accepting help with repairs at his refueling station (a violation of the
  rules). Alexander also crashed out, but Oliver Godfrey set a new average speed
  record of 47.63 mph taking first place in the five-lap, 189-mile Senior TT
  race in 3 hours, 56 minutes and 10 seconds! The second-place finisher Charles
  Collier riding a Matchless was disqualified for illegal refueling giving
  Charles Franklin second and Arthur Moorhouse third. Indian became the first
  foreign manufacturer to win the TT and the first ever clean sweep by a factory
  team. Oliver became the first Senior TT winner, the first to win on the
  Mountain course and would hold the first motorcycle race record on TT's
  Mountain Circuit. Godfrey would return to the Isle of Man three more times, he
  failed to start in 1912, he was DNF (did not finish) for 1913, but in 1914 he
  managed to claim 2nd place at the TT. At the outbreak of WWI Godfrey enlisted
  in the Royal Flying Corps and was posted at Fienvillers France to the 27th
  Squadron in June of 1916. On September 23rd during the Battle of the Somme,
  Oliver Godfrey was on an early morning bombing raid over Cambrai when he was
  spotted by a "Jagdstaffel 2" hunter squadron of the the German Imperial Army
  Air Service and shot down. Cambrai was situated quite far behind enemy lines
  and Oliver's body was never recovered. His memorial is Ref. IV. F. 12. at
  Point-du-jour Military Cemetery, Athies, near Arras.
