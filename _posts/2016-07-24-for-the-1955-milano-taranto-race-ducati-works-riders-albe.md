  For the 1955 "Milano-Taranto race", Ducati works riders Alberto Gandossi and
  Francesco Villa rode 100cc Mariannas but Giuliano Maoggi would get a 125cc
  Gran Sport. It had been just a couple of weeks after the "Motogiro d'Italia"
  that Taglioni decided to increase the 100 to 125cc, for a slightly more
  powerful version of the Gran Sport. But inspite Maoggi's added power, Degli
  Antoni on a 100cc Marianna won the race with an astounding average of 103.172
  km/hr, while Maoggi finished in 21st place. It was this loss that motivated
  Taglioni to design a double overhead camshaft engine. Giuliano Maoggi would
  get a dohc 125cc ride and was named the overall winner of the 1956 Motogiro.
  At the Swedish GP in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 spectators Degli
  Antoni finished the race in 1st place at a record-breaking speed of 48 minutes
  and 8.1 seconds on the dohc 125cc Grand Sport. With this spectacular victory,
  Degli Antoni became known as an "unbeatable rider" and Ducati won the respect
  of their competition. In 1958, a year before its official withdrawal from
  competition Ducati came out with the Triple-camshaft single-cylinder Desmo 125
  that Taglioni worked to perfect since 1956. He also developed the
  Twin-cylinder which came in third at Monza and was designing a double-camshaft
  four-cylinder!
