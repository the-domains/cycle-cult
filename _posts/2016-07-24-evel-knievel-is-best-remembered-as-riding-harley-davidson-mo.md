  Evel Knievel is best remembered as riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles
  particularly the XR-750, but for his first known jump (over a crate of
  rattlesnakes and two mountain lions) he used a 250cc Honda. For his next jump
  on January 23, 1966 he got Bob Blair, the West coast distributor for Berliner
  Motors to provide him with a Norton Atlas of all things. He only used the
  Norton for one year and thenswitched to using a Triumph Bonneville T120.
  Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New Year's Eve 1967.
  Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports but
  they declined. Knievel used his own money to have John Derek film the Caesars’
  jump. To reduce costs, Derek used his then-wife Linda Evans as one of the
  camera operators. It was Linda who filmed Knievel’s famous crash landing. In
  1968 Evel detailed plans for jumping the Grand Canyon using the "SkyCycle" a
  nitro-powered Triumph Bonneville with wings and twin jet engines pictured
  here. Thankfully that stunt never happened. By the way, Triumph notified
  Knievel that they would void the warranty on his Bonneville due to the
  addition of twin jet-engines. Then in another odd turn Evel secured
  sponsorship from Jack McCormack the US importer for Laverda. Knievel used the
  Laverda American Eagle 750cc motorcycle between December 1969 and April 1970.
  McCormack had been one of the people responsible for Honda’s hugely successful
  “You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda” ad campaign of the early 1960s.
