  The winner of the first Isle of Man motorcycle Tourist Trophy was Charlie
  Collier on a single-cylinder 432cc J.A. Prestwich Industries (JAP) powered
  Matchless motorcycle. Henry Collier Sr. had a bicycle factory in Plumstead
  that did quite well manufacturing bicycles under the "Matchless" brand for the
  British Army. Henry's sons Bert, Charlie and Harry Jr. joined the business and
  by 1899, Collier &Sons was experimenting with small engines mounted to a
  traditional bicycle. This 1904 photo is of Charlie and his brother Harry at
  the Olympia velodrome testing one of the early De Dion based engine designs.
  Charlie and Harry were returning from the 1906 International Cup Races in
  Austria by train when the idea of establishing a motorcycle race on the Isle
  of Man was first discussed. The inaugural Tourist Trophy race was held on May
  28, 1907 and the Matchless entry was a 432cc single-cylinder JAP motor making
  3 ½ horsepower ridden by Charlie Collier. The first TT had 25 entrants, 18
  single cylinder and 7 twin cylinder machines. The race course was rough over
  roads that were little more than horse and buggy trails. Charlie managed to
  win the race at an average speed of 38.21 mph with a total time of 4 hours, 8
  minutes and 8 seconds. Rem Fowler riding a 684cc 5-horsepower Peugeot-engined
  Norton came in second a good 13 minutes behind the Matchless. Norton later
  contested the win because Charlie had used his pedals whenever possible.
  Triumph's Jack Marshall also protested claiming that he had the fastest time
  when stops for repairs were deducted. Charlie Collier and Matchless's victory
  would be upheld, but for the 1908 TT race pedal gears were prohibited.
