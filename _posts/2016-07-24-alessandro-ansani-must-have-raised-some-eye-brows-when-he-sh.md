  Alessandro Ansani must have raised some eye brows when he showed up for the
  Sunday ride in Paris with a 3 cylinder motorcycle he designed and built!
  Ansani's interest in racing started early, by 1897 he was a cyclist on
  velodromes in Milan, Rome and Turin. It was his association with slayer and
  tandem competitors like Gougolz, Poulain or Jacquelin that piqued his interest
  in building motorcycle engines. His professional bicycling career spans a
  period of eight years, from 1897 to 1904. It was during this period that he
  began racing motorcycles competing in both disciplines as early as 1902. In
  fact, in a race organized by the Municipal Vélocipédique Union of Prefecture
  of the Seine, on July 20, 1902 he came in 2nd in the 100 kilometer race. In
  1904 Ansani is recruited by Alcyon, which in addition to bicycles,
  manufactures motorcycles. Alessandro's mechanical genius is apparent and
  Alcyon quickly puts him in charge of experimental engines and motorcycle
  development. Anzani was inspired by Joseph Farcot's three-cylinder steam
  engines to design a 3 cylinder W3 or what is referred to as a Fan engine
  layout as seen here in this 1905 photo of Ansani with a W3 engined racer.
