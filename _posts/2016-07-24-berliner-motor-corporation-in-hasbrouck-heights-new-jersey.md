  Berliner Motor Corporation in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey was the US
  distributor for Ducati from the 1950's through the 1980's and this image of
  the 350cc Desmo is the front of a 1969 sales flyer. Joseph Berliner founded
  his motorcycle business in New York City distributing and repairing Zündapp
  motorcycles east of the Mississippi in 1951, using contacts with that German
  manufacturer he had developed before World War II. He was a Hungarian Jewish
  refugee from the Holocaust who had spent time in Hungarian slave labor camps,
  and had lost 16 close family members on arrival at Auschwitz. Michael
  Berliner, the youngest of 5 brothers, was saved only because Joseph, and
  another Berliner brother, both of whom the SS intended to exploit for their
  skill as mechanics, convinced them that young Michael, too, was a mechanic.
  The Berliner brothers survived by maintaining a fleet of German army trucks.
  One brother would die of hunger and typhus, leaving only Joseph, Michael, and
  two other siblings alive after the war. Joseph emigrated to the US in 1947 and
  in 1957 he took over control of the International Motorcycle Company and their
  US distributorship of Zündapp, where he had previously been a partner. By 1965
  Berliner was the US distributor for Matchless, Moto Guzzi, Norton, Sachs,
  Zündapp, and Ducati as well as selling Metzeler tires.
