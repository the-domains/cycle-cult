  After WWII, DKW started producing small two-stroke machines in Ingolstadt.
  Erich Wolf assumed the leadership of race department and developed a new
  125cc, and 250cc two-stroke works racer. Germany was banned from international
  competition for the 1951 season and DKW spent the time making non supercharged
  two-strokes competitive with four-strokes. In 1952 a 3 cylinder 350cc machine
  was introduced with a nearly horizontal cylinder between two nearly vertical
  cylinders. The machine had a four speed gearbox and produced 46 hp and was
  capable of 140mph! The machine was so thirsty that it required a huge alloy
  fuel tank. By 1954 Robert Eberhost (via Porsche) was now in charge of the
  works development and he put engineer Helmut Georg in charge of the 350cc
  triple. The machine gained 38mm Dellortos, a bevel driven Bosch magneto and
  huge four leading shoe brakes front and rear. A streamlined hand hammered
  aluminum fairing was developed at the Munich Technical College's wind tunnel
  and used on the track. The motor would now make peak power at 9500 rpm and
  with August Hobl on board, DKW won the German Championship and took third in
  the World Championship in 1954.
