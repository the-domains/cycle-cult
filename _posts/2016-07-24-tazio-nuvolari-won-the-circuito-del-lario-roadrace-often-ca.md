  Tazio Nuvolari won the Circuito del Lario roadrace, often called the Italian
  TT in 1929. The race was extremely dangerous as it was run on public mountain
  roads around Lake Como which were closed to traffic during the race. The
  circuit was 22.7 miles (36.5 km) long with 300 curves, 50 of which were
  hairpins since the course cuts through the famous Ghisallo mountain pass.
  There is an elevation change of 1,805 feet (550 meters) during the course of
  the race and the road conditions were deplorable even by 1929 standards. But
  Tazio was legendary for his ability to handle stress and adversity. In 1925 at
  the Italian GP he crashed his Alfa Romeo P2 into a tree after the gearbox
  seized and was sent to hospital and ordered to rest for a month. But just one
  week later heavily bandaged he entered the Italian motorcycle GP and won the
  race. He had to be lifted on and off the motorcycle. As a motorcycle racer
  he'd won four consecutive 350cc Italian GPs (Gran Premio delle Nazioni)
  between 1925 and 1928, riding for Bianchi. On September 3rd 1939 Nuvolari won
  the GP of Belgrade, the last GP of the Golden Era for the Second World War
  which had started two days earlier. His life was not all victories, he lost
  both his sons Giorgio and Alberto before they reached the age of twenty. In
  1953 (by now was partly paralyzed) he died from an illness and was buried in
  his "racing uniform" with helmet, yellow jersey and blue trousers.
