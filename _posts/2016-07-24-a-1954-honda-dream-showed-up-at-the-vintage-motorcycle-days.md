  A 1954 Honda Dream showed up at the Vintage Motorcycle Days event this
  weekend. Manufactured only for the Japanese market the 220cc four stroke over
  head valve motorcycle was a quite remarkable accomplishment in Japan's post
  WWII recovery and helped secure Honda's future. In 1922 at 15 years old
  Soichiro Honda (the Old Man) became an apprentice at Art Shokai one of Tokyoâ€™s
  top automobile and motorcycle repair workshops. At the time most automobiles
  and motorcycles in Japan were foreign-made. In 1923, the Art Shokai started to
  make race cars, one of the cars built at the shop is in Honda's collection. It
  was built using a US built Mitchell automotive chassis and a secondhand
  Curtiss "Jenny" A1 biplane motor. Soichiro Honda was able to dodge military
  service in WWI because he was found to be color blind. In 1936 Honda and a
  partner started new venture 'Tokai Seiki' with the intent to manufacture
  piston rings while still working at Art Shokai. But by 1941 Japan was heading
  to war in the Pacific and the company was placed in control of the government.
  During the build up to war Honda invented an automatic milling machine for
  wooden aircraft propellers, a job previously done by hand. A single propeller
  produced by hand took a week to make but now it was possible to turn out two
  every thirty minutes.
