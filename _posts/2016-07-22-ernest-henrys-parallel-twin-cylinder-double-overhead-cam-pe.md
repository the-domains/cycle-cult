  Ernest Henry's parallel twin-cylinder double overhead cam Peugeot 500M's first
  race was at the Circuit de Rambouillet, piloted by Peugeot factory rider
  Lucien Delvaux on April 5th 1914. The course consisted of muddy country roads
  around the Rambouillet countryside, Delvaux won and the 500M was the only
  500cc machine to finish the race. Factory mechanic and rider Paul Pean entered
  the machine in a A.F.C. organized 'Records Day" speed event at Fontainebleau.
  Pean (photo) set a flying kilometer record in the 500cc class of 122.2 km/h
  (75.9mph) and 121.205 km/h for the mile. If not for the start of WWI the 500M
  would have been entered in the French GP. Development was discontinued and in
  1915 Ernest Henry left Peugeot.
