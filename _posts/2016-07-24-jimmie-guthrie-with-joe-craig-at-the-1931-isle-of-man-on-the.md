  Jimmie Guthrie with Joe Craig at the 1931 Isle of Man on the Norton CS1 500
  that would dominate the TT for years. Guthrie's first TT win was in the 1930
  lightweight race on an AJS at the age of 33. The first year he raced at the TT
  was 1927 when he was offered a New Hudson motorcycle factory ride. He did not
  disappoint by coming in second place behind two-time TT winner Alex Bennett.
  Jimmie also won the 1935 and 36 German 500cc Grand Prix. The victory at the
  1936 German GP was made even more satisfying because the trophy was presented
  by Adolf Hitler who was expecting a German victory. Guthrie would die in a
  fatal crash at the German Grand Prix the following year in what some suggest
  was no accident. In 1992 rider Stanley Woods made this statement : - Stanley
  Woods 1992 ("I am ready to swear that Jimmie was fouled. I saw the accident,
  because I rolled out with a broken fuel pump. Two riders passed me, a German
  and Guthrie. This was just before the downhill right-hander, who went through
  Jimmie at full throttle . The German knew that Guthrie was right behind him,
  as he already followed him for some time. But the German could not take full
  curve, lifted, moved to Jimmies line and forced him off the track in a number
  of young trees. He ended up in a ditch embankment. ") Suggesting that Kurt
  Mansfeld was to blame for the disaster. Guthrie had a two minute lead on Karl
  Gall with only a few hundred meters before the finish line when he struck
  Mansfeld who was a lap behind. It has long been speculated that a chain break
  or other mechanical malfunction caused the accident or maybe the Nazi's just
  couldn't bear another defeat, we'll never know.
