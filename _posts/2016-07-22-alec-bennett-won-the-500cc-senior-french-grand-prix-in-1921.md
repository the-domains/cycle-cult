  Alec Bennett won the 500cc Senior French Grand Prix in 1921 at Le Mans and the
  1922 French GP at Strasbourg (photo) on his Sunbeam TT. Sunbeam achieved its
  first T.T. victory when Tommy de la Hay came first in the Senior Race at an
  average speed of 51.79 m.p.h. In 1921, George Dance made a series of superb
  runs on Sunbeams at Brooklands. In the 350 c.c. class he set a new record at
  82.25 m.p.h. in the Flying Kilometer, and achieved 82.19 m.p.h. in the Flying
  Mile. In the 500 c.c. class he achieved 93.99 m.p.h. in the Flying Kilometer,
  87.35 m.p.h. in the Flying 5 Miles and 82.69 m.p.h. in the Standing 10 miles.
  Sunbeam achieved its second T.T. win in 1922 when Alec Bennett came in first
  in the 500cc Senior. Bennett's win at the TT created problems at Sunbeam
  because the win led to a disagreement between Alec and Tommy de la Hay. Both
  men wanted to be regarded as the leading Sunbeam rider. Sunbeam boss, Sidney
  Bowers intervened and chose Tommy, and Alec Bennett left Sunbeam to work for
  Douglas. He didn't ride for Sunbeam again until 1929. Alec Bennett had five
  career wins at the Isle of Man TT races starting in 1922 on a Sunbeam, 1924
  Senior 500cc Norton, 1926 Junior 350cc Velocette Ktt, 1927 Senior 500cc Norton
  CS1 and the 1928 Junior 350cc Norton. After racing with the works Norton team
  and also with the factory Sunbeam and Velocette teams, Bennett retired from
  motorcycle racing in the 1930s to concentrate on his retail motor-trade
  business in Southampton, Hampshire.
