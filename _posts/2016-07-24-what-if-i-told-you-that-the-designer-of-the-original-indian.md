  What If I told you that the designer of the original Indian Motorcycle, Oscar
  Hedström whipped out a revolver and fired it during a race in 1904?...well
  it's true! George Hendee and Oscar Hedström were both participants in the
  inaugural F.A.M. (Federation of American Motorcyclists) annual meet. The event
  started on Saturday July 1904 with a 271 mile endurance race from New York
  City to Albany and back. Oscar Hedström was chased by a dog at one point in
  the race and unable to out run the dog on his 1 3/4 hp Indian he pulled out a
  revolver and shot at the dog! This is the quote published in the July addition
  of The Automobile, "Oscar Hedström was annoyed by a yelping dog on the
  out-ward journey and tried to give the beast a dose of bird-shot from a
  revolver, holding the weapon in his right hand and aiming it backward under
  his left arm". Apparently, Hedström suffered powder burns in his armpit but
  still finished the race in good time. The FAM meet was a week long affair with
  several competitions including a fuel economy run, hillclimb races, a quick
  starting competition and a slow race. Another interesting requirement of the
  event was that no repairs other than roadside adjustments could be made to the
  machines. The motorcycles were impounded each night and as a result the same
  equipment was used for each competition thus leveling the playing field with
  no special preparations allowed for a particular event. George Hendee, Oscars
  co-founder of Indian Motorcycles also competed in some of the events. Hendee
  came in third in the economy run having traveled 42.1 miles on a single quart
  of gasoline. The Automobile article remarked that " George M. Hendee, also on
  an Indian, covered 42.1 miles, which is a good showing in view of the fact
  that the rider weighs over 240 pounds". Oscar Hedström won the hillclimb races
  with a 1:03 minute time. The FAM was officially formed on September 7, 1903
  during a meeting of 93 enthusiasts at a clubhouse in Brooklyn. The Motorcycle
  Manufacturers Association, formed in 1908 and the Motorcycle and Allied Trades
  Association was formed in 1916. By 1924 the M&ATA had registered over 10,000
  riders that same year they created a division called the "American Motorcycle
  Association" to control rider registration, activities, and issue sanctions
  for national events. As of April 30, 2015 the AMA has 214,517 members.
