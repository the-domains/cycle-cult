  The DKW RM350 two-stroke three-cylinder engine used light-alloy barrels with
  cast-in liners and produced a claimed maximum rpm of 12,000. The Ignition was
  via a Bosch magneto driven at half engine speed by bevel gears. It had a
  four-speed gearbox in unit with engine and a chain final drive. The engine
  used a three-port inlet, transfer and exhaust system with a hemispherical
  combustion chamber andcentral plug. The outer cylinders were parallel, and the
  center one lay horizontal at 6o째 from the others. A 120째, three-throw
  crankshaft was used, running in five roller bearings. In 1952 DKW works
  development engineer Erich Wolf was probably the first to fit expansion
  chambers to a two-stroke engine. Although the concept was patented in 1928 by
  Paul Schmidt and used during WWII for the pulse jet engines that powered the
  V1 flying bombs. The DKW triple was know as the "screaming three" for the ear
  splitting sound it would make on "the pipe" at full bore.
