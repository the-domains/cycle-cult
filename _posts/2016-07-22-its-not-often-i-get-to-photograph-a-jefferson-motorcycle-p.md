  It's not often I get to photograph a Jefferson motorcycle. Perry E. Mack
  designed the engine in 1910 and it is speculated that he may have ridden for
  Harley Davidson as early as 1905. In 1911 Mack became the president and chief
  engineer at Waverly Manufacturing Company in Cambridge (formerly the
  Kenzer-Waverly Cycle Co.), Mack began selling his motors under the Waverly
  brand name. The overhead valve single cylinder engine was well suited for
  racing and success at the racetrack built a strong following amongst early
  riders. Waverly Manufacturing moved to Jefferson, Wisconsin around 1911 and
  the motor was now branded as P.E.M. a nod to it's designer Perry Mack. By
  early 1912 the company was building complete single cylinder motorcycles newly
  branded as the Jefferson reflecting the city where they were built. The v-twin
  cylinder machine pictured here was introduced in 1913 but inspite of it's
  successes at the racetracks the last Jefferson motorcycle was produced in
  1914. At this point only 3 Jefferson / P.E.M. v-twin motorcycles are know to
  have survived.
