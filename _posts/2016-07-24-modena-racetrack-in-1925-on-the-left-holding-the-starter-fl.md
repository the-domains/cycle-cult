  Modena racetrack in 1925, on the left holding the starter flag is Enzo
  Ferrari. At the far right is Francesco Stanguellini next to his son Vittorio
  (in the shorts) who would take control of the Stanguellini brand at 19 years
  old when his father dies unexpectedly. the Scuderia Stanguellini team rider on
  Vittorio's left is Bezzant riding a Mignon. In 1931 Enzo Ferrari approached
  Vittorio Guerzoni at Mignon about developing an new racing motorcycle for the
  Ferrari race team. A racing Norton 'International' was purchased and
  disassembled so Mignon engineer Vittorio Bellentani could create a
  shaft-and-bevel single cylinder ohc engine similar the Norton with
  unit-construction engine and four-speed gearbox. But the prototype machine
  didn't prove to be as worthy as the British bike so the project was abandoned.
  Vittorio Bellentani would later in 1940, design the very first Ferrari racing
  the '815'.
