  Naomi Taniguchi became the first Japanese racer to compete at the world
  championship level when Honda entered him in the Isle of Man TT. This was the
  first time for Honda to compete and motorcycle they developed for that race
  was the RC142 works machine, fitted with an air-cooled, 4-stroke, DOHC,
  4-valve, 2-cylinder 125cc engine. Honda fielded a three-rider team for the
  1959 TT. In the final, Naomi Taniguchi came in 6th, Giichi Suzuki placed 7th,
  and Junzo Suzuki finished 11th, with the team taking the Constructorâ€™s Prize.
  Naomi Taniguchi had finished nearly four minutes behind the rider in front and
  almost eight minutes down on the race winner, Tarquinio Provini. Honda
  realised that they had some work to do. For 1960, alongside a team of Japanese
  riders, Honda decided to recruit experienced privateer Tom Phillis to help
  them with technical feedback. During the 1960 world championship Tom Phillis
  qualified second fastest for the Isle of Man 125cc race, but a crash in the
  250cc event at Assen saw him replaced by his friend Jim Redman who stunned
  everyone by lapping two seconds faster than Phillis had managed. The RC143
  finished in the points five times, the best results were two fourth places.
  Honda was third in the constructor championship behind the MV Agusta and MZ.
