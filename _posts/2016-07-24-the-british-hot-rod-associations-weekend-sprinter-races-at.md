  The British Hot Rod Association's weekend sprinter races at Santa Pod Raceway
  must have been quite a sight to see in 1967. The races were staged at night
  and a bunch of riders were pitting duel engined machines against the clock.
  This is a shot of Pete Allen's "Magnum Opus" with a pair of pre-unit
  construction Tiger 110 engines run through an AMC gearbox. The 380 lb sprinter
  runs on straight methanol pushed through a 2 1/16th bore Wal Phillips-type
  fuel injector by a Shorrock blower. Pete wasn't the only multi engine sprinter
  at the track on those summer nights. Mick Merrick raced a duel Vincent engined
  sprinter as did Roy Liddiard and George Brown. Michael Cook had a BSA twin and
  Eamon Hurley raced a twin engined Manx Norton. Of course there was Alf Hagon's
  blown twin engined JAP machine and let's not forget Ian Richardson's
  "Moonraker" had a 2000cc Butterworth F1 engine with four Norton Manx top ends!
  It was a great time for watching what would become legends of speed. The
  "Magnum Opus's" best run at Santa Pod....157mph.
