  The Triumph motorcycle is always thought of as the quintessential English
  motorcycle but actually it's roots are in Germany. The company was started by
  Siegfried Bettmann, who had emigrated from Nuremberg, to Coventry, England in
  1893. Bettmann had been working as a translator and foreign correspondent when
  he established the S. Bettmann & Co, Import Export Agency selling bicycles
  made in Englandre-branded as "Bettmann" and importing German made sewing
  machines. In 1886, Siegfried replaces the brand name Bettmann with the name
  Triumph, because he felt like the name might have a more universal appeal.
  Initially, he registered his company as New Triumph Co. Ltd. but later changed
  the name to “The Triumph Cycle Company.” In 1887 having received some
  financial investment from the Dunlop Tyre Company, Siegfried hires an engineer
  from his home town of Nuremberg named Mauritz Johann Schulte as a junior
  partner in the firm. Schulte convinces Bettmann that they should manufacture
  their own products rather than sell other companies products and in 1888 they
  start to make their own bicycles. Around 1895 the company starts looking into
  manufacturing motorcycles under license and even imports an example of the
  Hildebrand & Wolfmuller cycle for analysis and testing ( H&W was the world's
  first production motorcycle). In 1896, Bettmann opens a second bicycle factory
  in Nuremberg, called Triumph-Werke Nürnberg AG (TWN). In 1902 the first
  Triumph motorcycle is produced, designed by Schulte, using a Belgian/Minerva
  2.25 HO, single-cylinder engine.
