  To some people Evel Knievel was the "Worlds Greatest Stuntman" while others
  see a legendary showman that sold more than $125 million worth of Knievel
  toys. Always the promoter, in the 1960's Evel owned a Honda auto dealership
  and any potential buyer who could beat Knievel at arm-wrestling got $500 off
  their car purchase (now that's a salesman!). The "Strato-Cycle" was produced
  to tie-in with the "Viva Knievel" movie featuring Evel Knievel himself.
  Apparently he rode this motorcycle in the movie although I don't remember the
  movie I do recall having the toy. And now after researching the photo I wish I
  still had the toy, it is super collectable and trading for around a thousand
  dollars! Who knew?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_La6maPxIs
