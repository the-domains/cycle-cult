  This Motorrad cover shows Noel Pope and the Brough Superior incased in it's
  streamlined aluminum body prior to the Salt Flats speed record attempt in
  1949. Blackburn and General Aircraft of Brough, East Yorkshire, built the body
  which incorporated a large tail fin and was based on well established aircraft
  design. A third scale model was even constructed for testing in the company's
  wind tunnel. With a frontal area of 8.4 square feet, the drag coefficient was
  determined to be 0.00026 and at Bonneville's altitude it was estimated that it
  could reach a speed of 213 mph. Noel Pope was traveling at 150 mph in second
  gear when the machine started to veer to the right towards the 4 inch deep
  salt at the side of the track. Noel shifted his weight to the left in hopes of
  countering the drift, without effect so he then attempted to apply some
  steering input using the handlebars but the machine went into a high speed
  lock-to-lock wobble and crashed. Noel was luckily thrown clear of the carnage
  and escaped serious injury, tumbling along the salt ahead of the bike before
  ending underneath it.
