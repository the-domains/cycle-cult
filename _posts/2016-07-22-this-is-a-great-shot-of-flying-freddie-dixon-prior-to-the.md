  This is a great shot of "Flying Freddie" Dixon prior to the race at Circuit de
  la Sartre in Le Mans, France on 7/22/1921. In the 1920s, the course was
  unpaved and drove from the frighteningly narrow pits on Rue de Laigné straight
  into the city, and took a tight hairpin right-hander near the river Sartre
  Pontlieue bridge, left the city again on the rather straight street now named
  Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder. Freddie's solo Douglas looks
  to be the 4 HP model with front and rear brakes. After WWI, Dixon went into
  business for himself at Park Garage on Linthorpe Road, Middlesbrough and
  competed in motorcycle races in various categories through out the 20's. He
  worked closely with Douglas in their Design and Racing Departments especially
  after his victory in the 1923 Isle of Man TT Motorcycle and Sidecar event.
  Freddie’s first solo TT win came in 1927 on a HRD machine. He retired from
  motorcycle racing in 1928 and left Douglas in 1930. After leaving Douglas,
  Freddie began to design and market a water-cooled 4 cylinder motorcycle but
  the Depression put an end to that venture. In 1932 Freddie began automotive
  racing with his own specially prepared Riley cars. He won the British Racing
  Driver Club 500 Mile Race at Brooklands in 1934 and 1936. he was the only man
  to lap Brooklands at 130mph in a car of less than 2 liters. In 1935 and 1936
  he won the RAC TT car races held at the Ards circuit in Northern Ireland with
  his Riley. He is the only driver ever to have won TT races on two, three and
  four wheels, a record that still stands today. In 1938 Brough Superior based
  their 996 cc Four cylinder (doubly opposed) OHV, ‘Golden Dream’ on Freddie and
  'Ike' Hatch's designs but production was stopped by the outbreak of WWII in
  1939. In 1948 he was contacted by the Douglas motorcycle company to help in
  the development of their T35 motorcycle which was one of the first real new
  British post war designs, he redesigned the top half of the engine and these
  modifications resulted in the new Mark 3 Douglas machine. Dixon died on the
  5th of November 1956 in Reigate, Surrey at age 64.
