  "Gunga Din" is the most famous works racer to come out of the Vincent factory

  the Series B Rapide and wanted to see if the new machine had racing potential.
  So in 1947 Philip Vincent asked works test rider George Brown and his brother
  Cliff who also worked at Vincent to develop a race bike out of available
  Rapide spares. Cliff was the factory race mechanic and he started with a well

  high lift cams and extra valve springs. He fitted larger carbs and George
  modified the frame using the engine as a stressed member and a cantilever
  design swing arm with two dampers similar to a modern Monoshock system (only
  25 years earlier).

"Gunga Din" is the most famous works racer to come out of the Vincent factory at Stevenage. Vincent's lead engineer Australian, Phil Irving was developing the Series B Rapide and wanted to see if the new machine had racing potential. So in 1947 Philip Vincent asked works test rider George Brown and his brother Cliff who also worked at Vincent to develop a race bike out of available Rapide spares. Cliff was the factory race mechanic and he started with a well used engine, massaging the internal components and adding a matched set of high lift cams and extra valve springs. He fitted larger carbs and George modified the frame using the engine as a stressed member and a cantilever design swing arm with two dampers similar to a modern Monoshock system (only 25 years earlier).

George Brown was already an established road racer winning many races on his 500cc Series A Comet Special, known as his "Cadwell Special" for his numerous wins at Cadwell Park. George began entering the 1000cc Rapide in several events setting a track record at Haddenham and winning everything from sprints to hillclimbs. Philip Vincent loaned the racer for a weeklong test ride to British motorcycle journalist Charles Markham for an article he was writing that would appear in the November 13, 1947, issue of Motor Cycling. It was this quote "You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din" from Rudyard Kipling's poem which Markham used in his article that gave the machine it's name while remarking that the Vincent exceeded the author's own capabilities.

In 1948, George Brown raced "Gunga Din" at the Isle of Man TT setting the fastest lap at 82.65 mph but George was robbed of victory when he ran out of fuel. Although, George showed amazing tenacity when he pushed his Vincent the final six miles to the finish line taking sixth place!

This photo of "Gunga Din" was taken in May of 1953 at Carrigrohane, Ireland and shows Philipe Vincent on the left with his wife Frida and racers Dennis O'Neill and Harry Lindsay. Lindsay set a new Irish speed record of 143 mph on "Gunga Din" that day. The improvements developed through racing experience formed the basis for the Black Shadow, and the Black Lightning the most notorious of all Vincent models.
