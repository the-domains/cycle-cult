  DKW was the worldâ€™s largest motorcycle manufacturer by the 1930's. Arnold
  Zoller was DKW's designer of the two-stroke split-engine singles that the
  company started building in 1931, they made DKW a world contender. Zoller was
  the two-stroke specialist of his time, and the father of the Zoller
  supercharger. It is unfortunate that Zoller died in December 1934 because he
  was a two-stroke genius. Infact in the 1930's he built a 12 cylinder 1500cc
  two-stroke race car with 6 pairs of parallel pistons (the twin pistons made
  supercharging possible)! If you've ever ridden a Harley Hummer or a BSA Bantam
  you can thank DKW because the design drawings of the DKW RT125 were given to
  both manufactures as part of war reparations. This photo from 1938 is a bunch
  of Wehrmacht soldiers crowded around a DKW SB 500. There were about 19,000
  SB-500's built between 1934 and 1939. In 1932, DKW merged with Audi, Horch and
  Wanderer to form Auto Union. After World War II, DKW was moved to West
  Germany, with the original factory becoming MZ.
