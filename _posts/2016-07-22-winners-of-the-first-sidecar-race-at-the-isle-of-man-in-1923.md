  Winners of the first sidecar race at the Isle of Man in 1923 "Flying Freddie"
  Dixon and passenger Walter Denny. Dixon and Denny won the race with an average
  speed of 53.15 mph on this Douglas with a banking sidecar chassis that was
  designed and built by Freddie Dixon. The complete outfit could be banked to
  either side for optimal cornering speeds. The sidecar wheel was mounted on a 7
  inch crank that was raised or lowered by the passenger with the long lever in
  front of the wheel. It should also be noted that the machine had disc brakes
  on all three wheels with the sidecar brake operated by the passenger!
