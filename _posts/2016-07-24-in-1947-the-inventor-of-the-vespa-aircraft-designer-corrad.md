  In 1947, the inventor of the Vespa, aircraft designer Corradino D'Ascanio,
  came up with the idea of building a light three-wheeled commercial vehicle to
  power Italy's post WWII economic reconstruction, an idea which found favor
  with Enrico Piaggio, the son of the firm's founder, Rinaldo. The very first
  Ape (Italian for honeybee, think Apis mellifera) were mechanically a Vespa
  with two wheels addedto the rear, with a flat-bed structure on top of the rear
  axle. By 1956 the Ape had a cab to protect the driver from the elements. The
  Model "C" (1956 â€“ 1963) came in no less than eight different body styles. The
  Ape has been in continuous production since its inception and has been
  produced in Italy and India.
