  Bert (Herbert) Le Vack earned the nickname the 'Wizard of Brooklands'. The
  only five hundred mile race every held at Brooklands was won by Le Vack, and
  he is also noted for winning two two-hundred mile victories at the track on
  the same day. Before WWI he worked for Daimler, Napier, and the London General
  Omnibus Company. He started racing in 1912 competing in the London to
  Edinburgh trials race.He competed in the 1914 Isle of Man and when the war
  broke out he tested and assembled aero engines. After the war P.J. Wallace
  hired Le Vack to work at his small workshop. With Bert, John Wallace built a
  single cylinder engine of his own design, the single-speed belt-drive "Duzmo".
  Le Vack won many racing events with the Duzmo even entering it in the 1920
  London to Edinburgh trial and the Isle of Man. After competing in the IOM Le
  Vack joined the London Depot of Hendee Manufacturing Co, who made Indian
  motorcycles in Springfield, Massachusetts. While at 'Indian', Bert was
  instrumental in developing the eight valve Indian engine. Le Vack won the
  famous 500-Mile Race at Brooklands in 1921 on an Indian Powerplus with an
  average speed of 107.5 miles per hour! Bert Le Vack favored of using
  alcohol-based fuels in racing and this brought him to the attention of John A.
  Prestwich in Tottenham in North London, who hired Bert as a designer for his
  famous JAP racing engines. This is the JAP powered Brough Superior Bert Le
  Vack set a new world speed record of 119.05 mph at Arpajon, France on 6th of
  July 1924. He returned in 1929 to set a further record for Brough Superior of
  129.00 mph on the same works SS100. When J.A. Prestwich closed down his racing
  department Le Vack moved on to New Hudson and the later to Motosaccoche in
  Switzerland. He was tragically killed testing one of their products in 1931.
