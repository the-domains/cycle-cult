  At the outbreak of WWI in August 1914, the 3½hp P&M (Phelon & Moore), had been
  undergoing assessment by the War Office prior to the commencement of
  hostilities, and it was chosen as the official motorcycle transport for the
  newly formed Royal Flying Corps. This is a fantastic shot of the P&M assembly
  plant from around that time. The mainstay of production prior to WWI was a
  3½hp single that wouldbe progressively developed, gaining magneto ignition, a
  contracting band rear brake, P&M's own front fork and a mechanical inlet
  valve. In 1913 a new 3 ½ HP engine was presented with bore and stroke
  dimensions of 84.5 X 89 mm. This engine was nominally rated at 3 ½ HP but
  actually delivered up to 5 HP. This improvement was carried out to meet the
  increasing demand for sidecar mounts.
