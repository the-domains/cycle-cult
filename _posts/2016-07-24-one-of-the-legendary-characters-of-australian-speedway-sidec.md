  One of the legendary characters of Australian Speedway Sidecar racing, was
  Charles ‘Chook’ Hodgekiss. He was one of the best riders of his era. The
  highlight of his career was winning the 1952 Australian Championship. Aussie
  Speedway racers build some crazy rigs and Hodgekiss's ride has to be one of
  the most famous builds. His twin J.A.P. engined sidecar rig was often called
  the ‘Hodgekiss Horrors’ by the racing press because of some spectacular
  crashes on the track. The two 500cc J.A.P. motors coupled in tandem are
  impressive even sitting idle. the Sydney Sports Ground Speedway was world
  famous as the venue for Australian Championships where all speedway divisions
  of both solo motorcycle, sidecar and speedcars (midget autos) were raced in
  contests between Australia and England. In an era when death was an accepted
  risk of the sport, 12 competitors lost their lives while racing at the Sydney
  Sports Ground. In the most tragic accident, close friends off the track Norm
  Clay and Ray Duggan both died after crashing together in a Solo race at the
  track on 21 January 1950.
