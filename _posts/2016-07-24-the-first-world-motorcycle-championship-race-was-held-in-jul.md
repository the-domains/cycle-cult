  The first World Motorcycle Championship race was held in July of 1905 at the
  Velodrome Zurenborg in Antwerp, Belgium. It was won by Alessandro Ambrogio
  Anzani establishing the class world speed record of 100kph. Anzani's Buchet
  Alcyon 1/3 liter won the final after the Belgian Olieslagers took a fall on
  his Minerva, and he finished ahead of Frenchman André Pernette riding an
  Alcyon. With the proceeds of his race winnings, Anzani set up a small workshop
  at Asnières near Paris, building motor cycles, making engines, and completing
  a successful float-plane by summer 1907. Anzani is shown here on a 2,400cc
  parallel twin Buchet Alcyon at the Paris Velodrome. He would go on to built
  everything from a fully functioning hydrofoil to a 20 cylinder, 4 row radial
  aircraft engine and a 4 stroke W3 engine among other machines.
