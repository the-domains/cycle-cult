  This is the motor that changed everything, the inline-four cylinder Rondine.
  Development started in 1923 with two young engineers Carlo Gianini, Piero
  Remor and a wealthy businessman Count Bonmartini. The three men formed the
  company GBR (Gianini-Bonmartini-Remor)to manufacture a transverse 4-stroke
  motorcycle. Their first 490cc engine produced 28 hp at 6000 rpm. By 1928, the
  company now called Opra (Officine di precisione romana automobilistiche) was
  in production and the first model was presented at the international Auto Show
  in Milan. The 1928 engine was capable of 34 hp, considerably more powerful
  than other engines of the time. But further development was needed as the
  engine suffered failures in the racing events entered. Bonmartini became
  disenchanted in the design and hoped to sell the company but found no buyers,
  eventually he left and started the aircraft factory C.N.A. Piero Remor also
  left the company and in 1933 Carlo Gianini enlisted the help of Piero Taruffi
  to assist him in completely redesigning the racing motorcycle. The new
  motorcycle was named “Rondine” in honor of the Transadriatica airplane that
  had flown over Rome in 1922. The new design was water-cooled and fitted with a
  supercharger producing 60hp at 8500 rpm. With a partial fairing Taruffi would
  set a new motorcycle land speed record in 1935 of 244.5 km/h (151.925 mph) in
  the 500cc class. Count Bonmartini still owned the company and sold it to the
  Caproni aircraft Company including the Rondine motorcycle package. After
  aquiring the company in 1936 Caproni instructed Taruffi to find a buyer for
  the Rondine racers. Taruffi contacted Giuseppe Gilera who bought the
  motorcycles and tooling with the condition that Taruffi would join the Gilera
  Company. Taruffi and the Rondine would go on to break fifty world speed
  records including 170 mph on the flying kilometer in just 13.13 seconds.
