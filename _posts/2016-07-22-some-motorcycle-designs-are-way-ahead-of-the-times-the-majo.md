  Some motorcycle designs are way ahead of the times, the Major Moto was one.
  Designed shortly after the end of WWII in 1948 by Salvatore Majorca of Turin
  Italy this machine was a stunning aerodynamic masterpiece that unfortunately
  the world just wasn't quite ready for. The stylish body work conceals a 500cc
  Moto Guzzi v-twin power plant. The unique wheels also provided the suspension
  via a rubber disk bound to the rim and the hub supposedly providing a floating
  effect. It's hard to imagine this concept working, I can only imagine that
  initial testing was limited to a parking lot. None the less it's a very
  interesting prototype that must have grabbed a lot of attention in 1948!
