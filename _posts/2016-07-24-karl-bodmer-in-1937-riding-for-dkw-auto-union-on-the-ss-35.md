  Karl Bodmer in 1937 riding for DKW / Auto Union on the SS 350 a supercharged
  twin cylinder two-stroke at the "Bergrennen" mountain race. The engine block
  is finned and water cooled, looking similar to a square four. Mechanically it
  has five pistons, four 39.5mm pistons, plus a 100mm supercharging piston, all
  spinning on a common crankshaft by six con rods. It's considered a twin
  because the two pistons/barrels for each combustion chamber are used to 'time'
  the intake/exhaust cycle pulling both the incoming fuel and pushing exhaust
  gases out at the right time. The fifth cylinder is used to compress air into
  the magnesium crankcase, like a supercharger. The DKW Works Ladepumpe 'UL350'
  racer with reed vales produced 38hp and the later 'US350' rotary valve
  supercharged machines would produce 42 hp!
