  Peugeot factory rider Paul Pean in this photo won the 1926 Grand Prix of Lyon
  on the SOHC 500 twin. Pean had previously won the 1920 GP of Lyon on the
  earlier version of the 500 twin Peugeot. The original Ernest Henry design was
  the first 4 valve per cylinder double overhead camshaft motorcycle engine.
  Pean set speed records in 1914 at Fontainebleau and made record attempts at
  Brooklands on the gear driven DOHC 8-valve version designed by Marcel
  Grémillon but even with a new 3-speed gearbox the design proved fragile
  yielding limited success prior to WWI.
