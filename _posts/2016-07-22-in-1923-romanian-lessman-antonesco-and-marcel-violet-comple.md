  In 1923 Romanian, Lessman Antonesco and Marcel Violet completely redesigned
  the Peugeot 500M discarding the fragile gear driven double over head cam
  design, opting instead for a simpler bevel shaft driven design with a single
  camshaft and two valves per cylinder. On July 22nd 1923 René Gillard (photo)
  won the 500cc class at the French Grand Prix on the redesigned SOHC Peugeot at
  Circuit de Saint-André-de-Corcy in Lyon. Peugeot entered three riders in the
  1924 Isle of Man TT on the new 500 twins, Pierre Péan, Jéan Richards, and René
  Gillard. While the machines were fast the riders were inexperienced on the 37
  mile TT course and the machines were poorly suited for the TT circuit,
  especially the forks. Pean finished 11th, Richards 14th and Gillard had to
  retire. The Peugeot two-cylinder motorcycles were raced officially until 1927.
