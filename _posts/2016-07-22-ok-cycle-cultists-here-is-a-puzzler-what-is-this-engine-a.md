Ok, Cycle Cultist's here is a puzzler. What is this engine and who made it? Clues...it appeared in GP racing in 1964 and was a 350cc 4 cylinder short stroke with double overhead cams and a six speed gearbox. It was claimed to produce 59 hp at 13,000 rpm.

Built in the small Russian town of Serpukhov near Moscow, the Central Construction and Experimental Department was set up in 1942 for the design, development, and production of Soviet motorcycles. The name Vostok (Восток) celebrated the Soviet spacecraft (of the same name) that was used to put the first human into space, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in 1961\.
