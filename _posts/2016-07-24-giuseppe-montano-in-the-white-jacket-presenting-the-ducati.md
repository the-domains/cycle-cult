  Giuseppe Montano (in the white jacket) presenting the Ducati Apollo V4
  motorcycle to Joseph Berliner in 1964, with Fabio Taglioni. This was no small
  accomplishment for Ducati considering the largest motorcycle the company built
  at the time was 350cc. The Apollo ranks among the most ambitious (albeit
  unsuccessful) projects developed by the Borgo Panigale marque during the first
  half of the Sixties.Giuseppe Montano was Ducati CEO from 1952 to 1968 and was
  responsible for hiring Fabio Taglioni. Montano believed in mechanical
  innovation and was impressed by Taglioni's 1948 his mechanical-engineering
  degree project a 250cc, 90-degree V-four, his first-ever complete engine
  design. Montano gave Fabio the time, space, and resources to transform his
  ideas into real motorcycles. In fact Taglioni's first ohc, 750cc V-twin, was
  inspired by the Apollo's design.
