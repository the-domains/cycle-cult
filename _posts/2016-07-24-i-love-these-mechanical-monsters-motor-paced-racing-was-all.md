  I love these mechanical monsters! Motor-paced racing was all the rage in the
  early 1900's and just looking at one of these machines I can imagine the
  excitement of the race. The sound of this Ansani W3 Fan engine blasting around
  the wooden banking of an indoor velodrome with hundreds of cheering spectators
  must have rivaled that of the Roman Coliseum. The dictionary defines "Stayer"
  as 'a tenacious person or animal that continues to try hard rather than giving
  up'. That's a pretty good description of any cyclist willing to ride behind
  one of these beasts just inches from the rear wheel on a steeply banked wood
  plank track. The risk of death or devastating injury to the cyclist and the
  Stayer pilot can't be over stated. Before 1929 at least 47 professional riders
  and pacemakers died at velodromes in track cycling. Early newspaper accounts
  of some of these accidents where a tire blew or a chain broke are gut
  wrenching. One accident at the Parc des Princes in Paris was immortalized by
  Ernest Hemingway in A Movable Feast with "where we saw that great rider Ganay
  fall and heard his skull crumple under the crash helmet as you crack a
  hard-boiled against a stone to peel it on a picnic."
