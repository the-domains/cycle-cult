  This is what Noel Pope's 1949 Brough Superior "Silver Fish" looks like without
  the streamlined shell. Check out the front mounted WADE RO10 rootes type
  blower. Can you imagine being hunched over this monster sealed inside an
  aluminum coffin speeding over the salt at 150 mph when all of a sudden it goes
  into a high speed wobble? Yikes!
