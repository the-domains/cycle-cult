  Naomi Taniguchi on the Honda RC142 at the 1959 Isle of Man TT where he placed
  6th and became the first Japanese racer to compete at the world championship
  level. The RC142 works machine was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, DOHC, 4-valve,
  2-cylinder 125cc engine that borrowed heavily from the NSU Rennmax. Taniguchi
  finished sixth, more than 7 minutes behind MV-mounted race winner Tarquino
  Provini. 1959 was the last year 125s raced the short course, rather than the
  more-demanding Snaefell Mountain circuit. Honda won the Constructorâ€™s Prize
  with Taniguchi in 6th, Giichi Suzuki placed 7th, and Junzo Suzuki finished
  11th. Honda motorcycles eventually scored seven individual TT victories and
  more than a dozen world championships, in every displacement category from 50
  to 500cc, before withdrawing from international motorcycle competition in '67
  to focus on Formula 1 car racing. Naomi Taniguchi's most successful season was
  in 1960 when he finished in tenth place in the 125cc world championship. In
  2009 at the Twin Ring Motegi track to mark the 50th anniversary of Honda's
  participation in World Grand Prix racing, Naomi Taniguchi at age 73 fired up a
  restored RC142 and did an impressive lap of the course!
