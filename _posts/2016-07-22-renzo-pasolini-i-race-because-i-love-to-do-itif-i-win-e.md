  Renzo Pasolini "I race because I love to do it...if I win, even better!"
  Pasolini was born in Rimini, Italy, and was a works rider for Aermacchi,
  Benelli and Harley-Davidson. In 1962, he debuted with the Aermacchi 175cc, and
  his two first-place finishes were ahead of Giacomo Agostini! He took a
  two-year break from racing to complete his military service and returned in
  1964, racing Aermacchi 250cc and 350cc bikes at the senior level. In the 1965
  Italian championship, Pasolini, racing a Benelli, finished second in the 250cc
  class and third in the 350cc class. In 1966 in the final race of the Italian
  championship, Pasolini won on the then-new four-cylinder Benelli 500. This
  marked the start of his epic battles with Hailwood riding for Honda, and
  Agostini riding for MV Agusta.
