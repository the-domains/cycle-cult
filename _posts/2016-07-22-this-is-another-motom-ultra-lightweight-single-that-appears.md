  This is another Motom ultra-lightweight single that appears to have a twin cam
  head similar to the Mondial racing singles of the early fifties. I haven't
  uncovered more information about it yet but the styling is fantastic. There is
  an active Motom collector association in Italy and many machines are still
  road worthy. Battista Battaglia is said to be the definitive Motom expert and
  spare parts guy in Italy.
