  In 1935 Norton decided to go after the 500cc worlds fastest 'Hour' motorcycle
  record at the concrete bowl track in Montlhéry, France. Jimmie Guthrie riding
  a 490cc Norton, displayed tremendous stamina and broke the one-hour record at
  a speed of 114.09 mph and in doing so broke the 50km, 50 mile, 100 km and 100
  mile records. Astonishingly, this also beat the records for the more powerful
  750cc and 1,000cc classes.
