  In 1926 daredevil Fred Osbourne thought it would be a good stunt to ride a
  motorcycle off a 200ft cliff wearing a parachute...Not! Fred Osborne was a
  "Thirteen Black Cats" member, the first group of Hollywood stunt pilots. They
  were also called the Suicide Club. Not surprisingly, it didn't go well. Fred
  survived the fall after the parachute failedto open only because the telephone
  lines helped break his fall, he was carried off the beach in critical
  condition. This wasn't Fred's first brush with death, at Clover Field in Santa
  Monica on November 7, 1926, Bobby Chase, a female parachutist, got caught in
  her plane's landing gear when she jumped. Her pilot Kenneth Montee, unable to
  help, could only circle at 60 M.P.H. while Bobby floundered helplessly 30 ft
  below the plane. Fred Osborne and Al Johnson, jumped into another plane and
  flew to her rescue. According to the Los Angeles Times, Osborne actually
  wing-walked on to Monteeâ€™s plane, and lowered himself down to the landing
  carriage where he managed to untangle the lines and cut the strap which was
  securing Chase. She deployed her parachute, landed on a street 2 miles away
  near Venice beach and sprained her ankle on a curb.
