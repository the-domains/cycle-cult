  Gene Vincent was a Mod? I'm not sure Vincent Eugene Craddock knew where the
  battle lines were drawn in British youth culture. He grew up in Norfolk,
  Virginia a big US Navy port so it's no surprise that he dropped out of school
  at seventeen and enlisted. Working-class families in US and England suffered
  harsh economic realities in the wake of WWII. Nor is it surprising that Gene
  re-enlisted and spent his $612 dollar re-up bonus money on a new Triumph. In
  some ways we can credit Vincent's motorcycle crash which shattered his leg
  with starting his music journey, because Gene had planned on being a career
  Navy sailor. After being medically discharged by the Navy he became involved
  in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent, and
  formed a rockabilly band called the Blue Caps (a term used in reference to
  enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy). The rock n roll scene aesthetics in the US
  at that point leaned heavily toward the Greaser look thanks to films like "The
  Wild One" 1953 and "Rebel Without a Cause" 1955. Vincent's huge hit
  "Be-Bop-A-Lula" came out in 1956 and drew comparisons to Elvis Presley.
  Between 1957 and 1959 Gene Vincent was on a roll. He toured Australia with
  Little Richard and Eddie Cochran in 1957 also appearing with them in the film,
  The Girl Can't Help It with Jayne Mansfield. Vincent's last American hit
  single "Dance to the Bop" was used in the movie Hot Rod Gang and the group
  performed the song on the nationally-broadcast Ed Sullivan Show.

Vincent's last American hit single "Dance to the Bop" was used in the movie Hot Rod Gang and the group performed the song on the nationally-broadcast Ed Sullivan Show.

It was a dispute with the US tax authorities and the American Musicians' Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band's equipment to pay a tax bill that led him to leave the US and try his hand in Europe.

On December 15, 1959, Vincent appeared on Jack Good's TV show Boy Meets Girl, his first appearance in England. It would be this performance that would forever define Vincent as a "Rocker" in England. He wore black leather, gloves, and a medallion, and stood in a hunched posture thanks to that crash on his Triumph that left him with a steel sheath around the leg. After the TV appearance he toured France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK performing in his motorcycle leathers. Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin" came out in 1964 and I'm not sure Vincent saw the coming change.
