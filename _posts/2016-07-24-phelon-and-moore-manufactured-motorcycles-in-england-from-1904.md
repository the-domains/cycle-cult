  Phelon & Moore manufactured motorcycles in England from 1904 to 1967. The
  sloping stressed member concept was patented in 1900 by Joah ("John") Carver
  Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner. After Harry Rayner died in a car accident,
  Joah went into partnership with Richard Moore and P&M motorcycles was
  established. I've always admired the large heavyweight sloping 40-degree,
  "Panther" single-cylinderengine's masculine appearance. The first Panther was
  launched in 1924 and was promoted as "The Perfected Motorcycle". You often see
  Panthers attached to sidecars, a task they are well suited for thanks to its
  large flywheels and high torque output. The 1935 Model 100 was the machine on
  which Miss Florence Blenkiron and Miss Teresa Wallach undertook the epic
  journey from London to Cape Town, crossing the Sahara. The 1933 Model 100 had
  a Sturmey-Archer 4-speed, hand-change gearbox, in 1934 a Burman 4-speed
  foot-change gearbox was introduced. This amazing technical illustration was
  done by Francis Alexander Simpson for "The Motor Cycle" where he worked from
  1917 to 1932 when he left and began a freelance illustration career.
