  The Harley-Davidson flathead engine started with the Model W's flat-twin,
  produced from 1919 to 1923 and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder
  export-model 21-cubic-inch (340 cc) and 30.5-cubic-inch (500 cc) singles and
  in Servi-Cars until 1973. In 1930, the 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cc) VL flathead
  replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve
  configuration. The VL hada single down tube frame and total loss oiling,
  culminating in an 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cc) version (VLH) in 1935. In 1952, the
  K series flatheads was introduced, designed to compete with British sporting
  motorcycles of the time, because the AMA allowed the 750 cc sidevalves to
  compete against 500 cc overhead valve bikes. The K models featured a unit
  construction engine and transmission case. The K series was replaced by the
  overhead valve Sportster in 1957. However, racing versions of the 750 cc K
  model, designated KR, continued to be produced in very limited numbers for
  some time after, winning both road races and dirt track events against
  overhead valve bikes limited to 500 cc through 1969, when the AMA finally
  decided to change the rules and made the flathead uncompetitive. The K racers
  were replaced first by the iron-head XR 750 cc overhead valve engine, and two
  years later by the alloy-head XR, which continues in service in flat track
  racing to this day.
