  Ángel Nieto is one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time that
  you may never have heard of unless you are Spanish then of course you know him
  as a motorcycle God. Barry Sheene considered him among the greatest motorcycle
  racers of all time. An incredible 13 world championship titles in 50cc and
  125cc with 90 GP victories, he finished on the podium 500 times! He was also
  runner-up four times, twenty times champion of Spain in the various
  displacements of 50, 80, 125 and 250 cc, and five-time runner-up Spain. Nieto
  moved to Barcelona from Madrid as a young man and found a job at the Derbi
  motorcycle factory. He began his racing career in 1968 winning his first two
  amateur races. In 1969, he entered six races and was on the podium six times
  including two first, and three second place finishes giving him his first 50cc
  world title. Though he was never successful at the world level racing in the
  larger displacements, he won Spanish National Championships in the 50 cc, 125
  cc, 250 cc, 500 cc and 750 cc classes. His total of 90 Grand Prix victories is
  third only to the 122 by Giacomo Agostini, and the 110 of Valentino Rossi.
