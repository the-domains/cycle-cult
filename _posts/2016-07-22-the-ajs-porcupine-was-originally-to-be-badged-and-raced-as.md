  The AJS "Porcupine" was originally to be badged and raced as a Sunbeam
  motorcycle. Associated Motor Cycles (AMC) was a British motorcycle
  manufacturer founded by the Collier brothers as a parent company for the
  Matchless and AJS motorcycle companies. It later absorbed Francis-Barnett,
  James, Norton and Sunbeam. AMC had big plans for re-launching the Sunbeam
  marque after the war and wanted leverage GP racing, the E90S model designation
  for the machine was "E" experimental, "90" a nod to the prewar Sunbeam Model
  90 works racers and "S" supercharged. Those plans fell through when rival BSA
  bought Sunbeam in 1943. Joe Craig the engineer best known for Norton's racing
  singles went to work for AMC briefly in 1939. Craig was tasked with replacing
  the heavy, ill handling supercharged AJS V4's. A near horizontal parallel twin
  cylinder layout was adopted to reduce weight and allow for positioning of the
  gear driven Roots type blower above the gearbox for a lower center of gravity
  and improved handling. Just like the last V4's it was also to be water-cooled
  to handle the heat generated with forced induction. AMC designer Vic Web
  worked on the project after Craig's departure with the help of Phil Irving.
  Irving who had previously worked for Velocette and Vincent was hired by Joe
  Craig in 1942. While at Velocette Irving had designed the prototype Model 'O'
  Velocette, a shaft-drive twin cylinder machine of 600cc capacity and loosely
  based on the supercharged 500cc racing machine known as 'The Roarer'.

Those plans fell through when rival BSA bought Sunbeam in 1943\. Joe Craig the engineer best known for Norton's racing singles went to work for AMC briefly in 1939\.

A near horizontal parallel twin cylinder layout was adopted to reduce weight and allow for positioning of the gear driven Roots type blower above the gearbox for a lower center of gravity and improved handling. Just like the last V4's it was also to be water-cooled to handle the heat generated with forced induction. AMC designer Vic Web worked on the project after Craig's departure with the help of Phil Irving. Irving who had previously worked for Velocette and Vincent was hired by Joe Craig in 1942\. While at Velocette Irving had designed the prototype Model 'O' Velocette, a shaft-drive twin cylinder machine of 600cc capacity and loosely based on the supercharged 500cc racing machine known as 'The Roarer'.

Motorcycle racing in Europe went through a hiatus during most of WWII and when GP racing resumed in 1946 the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) banned forced induction from road racing. The AJS E90S development was halted and hastily converted to and air cooled, atmospheric induction design. The cylinders of the new design were inclined 15 degrees, nearly horizontal. It was 68mm by 68.5mm and produced around 40bhp at 7600rpm. It had double overhead cams and overlapping hairpin-type valve springs. The main engine castings were of magnesium alloy with the single-piece, forged steel crankshaft that was supported by three bearings. Straight-cut gears drove a unit construction four-speed close-ratio gearbox. The engine was positioned in the duplex frame facing forwards and a revised cylinder head with spine-like fins earned it the name "Porcupine". The parallel twin first took to the track in 1947 and was an astonishing engineering achievement. Ted Frend was the first rider to win a race on the bike. The bike was not without problems with carburetion being a major issue on a motorcycle designed to be supercharged. At the 1949 Senior TT Les Graham was forced to retire just two minutes from the finish with magneto problems. But Graham would bring AJS a victory at the Swiss GP and Ulster, ultimately taking first place in the inaugural Grand Prix World Championships on the Porcupine, a win that was to become AJS' and Graham's only major title.
