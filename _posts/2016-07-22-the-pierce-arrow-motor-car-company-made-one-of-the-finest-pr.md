  The Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company made one of the finest pre-war era luxury
  automobiles but the company started by George N. Pierce also manufactured some
  innovative motorcycles and bicycles. The first Pierce bicycle appeared in 1890
  and they started manufacturing automobiles in 1901. In 1906 the Pierce Cycle
  Company led by George N. Pierce's son, Percy would become a separate
  enterprise. Percy Pierce acquired a Belgian FN Four cylinder motorcycle in
  1908 and brought it to America to disassemble and study. The FN Four's engine
  was designed by Paul Kelecom who had designed single cylinder engines prior to
  the FN. Using the FN as "reference" the Pierce design department spent the
  next two years developing the innovative Pierce Four. Large diameter tubing
  was used and the engine became a stressed member of the frame construction.
  The frame also held oil and gasoline internally and concealed the control
  cables. The Pierce Four had a T-head, and cam-driven intake valves and was
  shaft driven. By 1910 a two-speed transmission was offered and the company
  also offered a single cylinder model which was belt driven. Pierce bicycles
  had since 1900 offered a chainless shaft drive system and other innovations
  like the Cushion Frame launched in 1898 which featured a shock absorber on the
  post connecting the rear axle to the seat pillar and sprung forks in 1903. The
  Pierce Bicycles were endorsed by 16 time national bicycle champion Frank
  Kramer. The company slogan "Tried & True" appeared on all their advertising
  material. The Pierce Four motorcycle is said to have cost more to build than
  its sale price and eventually bankrupted Pierce Motorcycle Company after fewer
  than 500 were built. The last Pierce Motorcycle was produced in 1914, bicycles
  would remain in production at the original Buffalo, NY factory until 1918.
  That same year the Emblem Manufacturing Company in Angola, NY purchased the
  bicycle business and would continue to manufacture a Pierce bicycle line until
  1940. The Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company went under in 1938. This photo is of
