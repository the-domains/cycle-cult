  Renzo Pasolini is remembered for his challenges on a Benelli 4 cylinder
  against Giacomo Agostini on his three cylinder MV Agusta in the 350 and 500
  classes. The antagonism between the two greatest Italian bikers of the time
  was intense. During his long dispute with Agostini, Pasolini collected ten
  victories with the Benelli 350 and two victories with the Aermacchi-HD 350. He
  won six 250 grand prix and six 250 and 350 Italian. He also raced in the
  United States with the official Harley-Davidson team, on the twin cylinder 750
  which took him to third place in 1972 at Ontario (a first for Harley
  Davidson). Pasolini lost his life in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza on 20 May
  1973. Renzo was not able to finish the 350cc race because of mechanical
  problems, withdrawing from competition with only four laps to go, and fell
  during the first lap of the 250cc race. Jarno Saarinen, immediately behind
  him, was unable to avoid him and fell as well, causing a chain reaction
  ultimately involving twelve riders and resulting in Pasolini's and Saarinen's
  deaths.
