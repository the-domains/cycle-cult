  Oscar Hedström built the first Indian prototype in 1901 and was co-founder of
  the Indian Motorcycle Company with George Hendee. Both Hedström and Hendee
  were bicycle racers before joining forces. George Hendee was the National
  Amateur High Wheel Champion in the US from 1882 thru 1886. After Hendee
  retired from professional racing he began selling bicycles and in 1897 he
  started his own manufacturing company in Springfield, Massachusetts. Oscar
  Hedström was a Swedish immigrant, a journeyman watchmaker and amateur bicycle
  racer. In his spare time Oscar built professional track bicycles. One of
  Hedström's cycle racing partners around 1896 was C.S. Henshaw who was touring
  the country racing bicycles with sponsorship provided by a tire manufacturer.
  In 1897 Henshaw met Kenneth Skinner who campaigned a De Dion engine powered
  tricycle and had just opened a dealership. Henshaw went to work for Skinner
  doing public motorcycle exhibitions at velodromes with renowned French racer,
  Henry Fournier. Over 150 different motorcycle and automobile manufacturers
  licensed the De Dion engine and Skinner was the sole US importer. In 1899 C.S.
  Henshaw teamed up with Oscar Hedström to build De Dion powered motor-paced
  racing cycles for Stayer bicycle racing on the high banked velodromes. Pacers
  were designed to split the wind for the bicyclists (Stayer) who rode in their
  draft while attempting speed records. It was at a Stayer race at Madison
  Square Garden in 1900 that George Hendee first saw one of the Henshaw-Hedström
  motorized tandem pacers. Impressed with the performance, George met with Oscar
  and posed the idea of building a lightweight motorcycle for everyday
  transportation of their own design. The two men became partners and by early
  spring of 1901 the first prototype machine was ready for testing. The photo
  here is from 1910 and shows an Indian V-twin setup as a pacer. Indian produced
  their first v-twin factory racer in 1905 and their first production V-twin was
  sold to the public in 1907. Oscar Hedström wasn't just content to design
  motorcycles, in 1903, he rode an Indian to a record 56 miles per hour on
  Ormond Beach in Florida. He continued attempting and coordinating record
  top-speed runs through the end of the decade. Oscar Hedström resigned from the
  Indian Motorcycle Company on March 24th 1913 after a disagreement with the
  board regarding dubious practices to inflate the company's stock values.
