  Tazio Nuvolari was known in his village as “the son of the devil” (il figlio
  del diabolo) because of his many dangerous exploits with bicycles, motorcycles
  and later cars. During the first world war he served in the Italian Army as a
  driver and he started racing motorcycles after the war when he was 28. In 1922
  he won the Campionato Mantovano Motociclistico on a Harley-Davidson. In 1923
  he was unbeatable with 8 first place finishes riding at times a Garelli 350, a
  Norton M18 in 500cc events and a 1000cc Indian Powerplus. His riding was
  noticed by the Bianchi team and he became a works rider and eventually Italian
  champion. At the Monza motorcycle Grand Prix he crashed during practice
  breaking both legs. After doctors put plaster casts on both legs he was told
  that it would be at least one month before he could walk again let alone race
  motorcycles. The next day he started the race having himself tied to his bike.
  His mechanics had to hold him upright at the start of the race and to catch
  him at the end...he won the race! From 1925 on he mostly competed on a Bianchi
  Freccia Celeste 350 motorcycle winning every race he entered. Nuvolari began
  racing cars in 1924 at the age of 32 while still competing in motorcycles. In
  1927 Tazio and another motorcycle racer Achille Varzi purchased a pair of
  Bugatti 35Bs and started their own automotive race team.
