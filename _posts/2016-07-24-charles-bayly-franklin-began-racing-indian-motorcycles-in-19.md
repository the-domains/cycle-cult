  Charles Bayly Franklin began racing Indian motorcycles in 1910. Billy Wells
  began importing Indians into the UK in May of 1909 at the urging of George
  Hendee. Billy was familiar with the Irishman because Charles was on the
  British team for the Coupe International races of 1905. He competed on a
  "special" of his own design powered by a J.A.P. V-twin engine and although he
  failed to finish the race,he became the first Irishman to participate in
  international motorcycle competition. Franklin was also on the British
  International team in 1906 with the Collier brothers Harry and Charlie on
  their Matchless'. He missed out on the inaugural Isle of Man TT race in 1907
  but competed in the 1908 IOM on another of his JAP engined "specials" this
  time a single cylinder machine with which he took 6th place. For the 1909 TT
  Franklin rode a Triumph motorcycle placing 5th. The 1909 TT was the second
  year Indian V-Twins raced the TT and Guy Lee Evans's close second place finish
  against the Collier brothers and their Matchless' may have convinced Charles
  that Indian motorcycles were the way to go. Whatever his reasons Franklin
  entered the 1910 TT as a privateer on an Indian V-twin with the support of
  Billy Wells the UK importer. Even though he didn't finish the race (crashing
  into a stone wall) Franklin was still impressed with the Indian enough to
  return to England, quit his day job at the Rathmines power station and become
  an Indian motorcycle dealer. And thus began Charles Franklin's journey with
  Indian motorcycles. Charles would go on to design motorcycles for Indian
  including the original Indian Scout of 1920, the original Indian Chief of
  1922, and the Indian 101 Scout of 1928.
