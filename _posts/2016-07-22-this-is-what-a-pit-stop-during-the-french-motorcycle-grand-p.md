  This is what a pit stop during the French Motorcycle Grand Prix looked like in
  the 20's. The rider is Paul Meunier on a 350cc Zürcher v-twin Alcyon
  motorcycle. Tire punctures were a huge problem on the unpaved course and Paul
  has several spare inner tubes around his waist. You can also see a pit worker
  pouring him a glass of cognac! The refueling gasoline is in the large tin
  pitcher and there is a selection of basic tools on the table as well. Paul
  Meunier won the 350cc French GP in 1921 and the 250cc GP in 1924. This photo
  was taken during the 1922 French Grand Prix in which Alec Bennett won the 500,
  Erminio Visioli 350 and Geoff Davison won the 250cc.
