  "Cannonball" Baker and Teddy Carroll set motorcycle endurance and speed
  records at the Cincinnati Speedway in August of 1917. The 2 mile wooden oval
  track was located north of Cincinnati between Crescentville and Mosteller
  roads in Sharonville. The track opened September 4, 1916 and was a copy of the
  Chicago Speedway Park with a wooden surface 60 feet wide on the homestretch,
  70 feet wide in the turns and 50 feet wide on the backstretch. The turns were
  banked at 19 degrees and reached 33 degrees at the very top. By 1917 the world
  was at war and the big three motorcycle involved in racing (Harley Davidson,
  Indian and Excelsior) had signed an agreement to suspend support for racing
  until the end of WWI. Factory support was still available for endurance runs
  and sanctioned speed challenges. Just four weeks prior Red Pankhurst riding
  for Harley Davidson had set new records and Cannonball Baker and Indian were
  determined to retake the 24 hour record. WWI was in full swing and the First
  Ohio Regiment under Colonel Galbraith, some 1,500 soldier were encamped at the
  track and I'm sure eager to watch the attempt. Baker would go after the 12 and
  24 hour solo records and Teddy Carroll and George Von Staden would attack the
  sidecar records both would also set 500 and 1000 mile records. Both machines
  were on the track at the same time and three stops were made during the first
  500 miles. The track was especially dangerous at night with very little
  lighting and close to midnight it started raining making the wood surface
  extremely slippery. The rain forced Baker to ride without googles and a bug
  struck him in the left eye. Not being able to see well Baker mis-judged a turn
  and slammed into the guard rail sending him and his machine sliding across the
  track for two hundred feet at 60 miles an hour. Luckily the bike suffered only
  a broken footboard and Baker was walked over to the First Regiments field
  hospital where his eye was attended to and he suffered only a bruised shoulder
  and some abrasions. Teddy and George pulled off the track as well and both
  machines were equipped with new lights. They were back on the track and back
  at it in 23 and a half minutes. By 2 o'clock the rain finally stopped and the
  men really started to pick-up speed again. The 1000 mile mark was reached at
  16:14:15 on the solo and at 18:48:30 for the sidecar. It was a big boost for
  the Hendee factory and Indian touted the records in their advertising with
  pride. The last racing event held at the Cincinnati Speedway was a 48 hour
  endurance race for Essex Automobiles held in December of 1919. The Speedway
  was abandoned and dismantled with the lumber shipped to Chillicothe, Ohio to
  be used in the construction of Camp Sherman, one of the new training camps for
  the War effort. The camp was built on top of Hopewell Native American mounds
  in the area which were bulldozed to make way for the 1,370 buildings
  constructed at Camp Sherman. The camp also housed German prisoners of war,
  POWs remained at Camp Sherman until September 1919, several months after the
  war had ended.
