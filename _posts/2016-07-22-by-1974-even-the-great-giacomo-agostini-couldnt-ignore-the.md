  By 1974 even the great Giacomo Agostini couldn't ignore the screaming
  2-strokes, he stunned the racing world by announcing that he would leave MV
  Agusta to ride for Yamaha. On his first outing for the Japanese factory, he
  won the Daytona 200 and went on to claim the 1974 350cc World Championship.
  Unfortunately injuries and mechanical problems kept him from winning the 500cc
  crown but he rebounded and won the 1975 500cc title, marking the first time a
  two-stroke machine won the premier class. Ago is shown here on the #2 bike at
  the start of the Brno Grand Prix rubbing shoulders with Patrick Pons also on a
  Yamaha in 1975.
