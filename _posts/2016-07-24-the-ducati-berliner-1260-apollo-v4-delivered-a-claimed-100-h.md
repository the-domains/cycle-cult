  The Ducati Berliner 1260 Apollo V4 delivered a claimed 100 horsepower at 7000
  rpm and was good for a top speed in excess of 120 mph. In fact it had too much
  power. When Ducati test rider Giancarlo Librenti took it out on the autostrada
  the specially made 16-inch rear tire (U.S. police regulations, required
  16-inch tires) came apart at high speed and locked up the rear wheel. To cure
  the problem atwin-carb version of the engine was detuned bringing the
  horsepower down to 65, still superior to the Harley Davidson police bikes of
  the day that it was intended to compete with. It was also lighter than the
  Harleys, weighing 596 pounds dry vs. the V-twin's 640 pound weight. Ducati
  reluctantly canceled the project early in 1965 with a retail price estimated
  to be $1500 dollars it would have been double the cost of the equivalent
  Harley.
