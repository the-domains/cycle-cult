  Matchless Motorcycles dominated racing on the Isle of Man in the early days.
  The Tourist Trophy was more of a reliability test than a speed contest at the
  time. Most entrants would suffer at least one crash and given the primitive
  machines of the day and the poor condition of the roads on the island, tire
  punctures and mechanical failures were to be expected. The TT organizers
  recognized this andmade fuel economy part of the program with fuel allotments
  closely monitored. For the second running of the TT in 1908 fuel limits were
  set and pedal gearing was outlawed. Having won the first ever TT, Matchless
  would again enter a single cylinder machine with Charlie Collier in the
  saddle. But it was Jack Marshall riding a Triumph single that would win the
  race with the Matchless coming in second out of the 37 machines entered. For
  the 1909 TT there would be no fuel consumption limits so Matchless entered a
  738cc JAP twin-cylinder machine setting a new lap record of 52.3 mph, this
  time with Harry Collier piloting the motorcycle. His winning time, three hours
  and thirteen minutes. Charlie Collier won the 1910 TT races as seen in this
  photograph and Harry Collier came in second out of the field of 80 riders that
  year. The Collier brothers TT wins didn't go unnoticed, the Matchless brand
  now included a range of single and twin cylinder motorcycles which were in
  high demand thanks impart to the boys racing successes.
