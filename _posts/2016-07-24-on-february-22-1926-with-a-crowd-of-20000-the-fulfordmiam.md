  On February 22, 1926 with a crowd of 20,000 the Fulford–Miami Speedway held
  it's only race. The track's banking was at 50°, and as a result, cars had to
  drive at a speed of 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) in order to remain on the
  track without sliding off. Because of the speed the track's configuration
  produced, the track was considered to be the fastest in the world. The track
  was destroyed that same year in the costliest hurricane in U.S. history. The
  1926 Miami hurricane damage would total $125 billion in todays dollars, triple
  that of Katrina. Its winds averaged 76.2 mph for 24 hours, the longest period
  on record for any area to experience hurricane-force winds. And never before
  had officials recorded an Atlantic hurricane with winds higher than 100 mph
  for more than an hour. the lumber that comprised the track's surface was
  scattered across the neighborhood, and was later, after being recovered, used
  by the city for reconstruction.
