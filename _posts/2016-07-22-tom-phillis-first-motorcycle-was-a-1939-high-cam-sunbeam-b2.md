  Tom Phillis' first motorcycle was a 1939 High Cam Sunbeam B25 that he bought
  while working as an apprentice mechanic in Sydney. Phillis began racing a
  Velocette MAC in Junior Clubman events around 1953. In 1955 his wife Betty
  helped him buy a BSA Gold Star and he started to get serious about racing. His
  next machine was this two year old Manx Norton that he is standing next to in
  this photo taken at Fishermans Bend, an old airfield circuit in Melbourne.
  Phillis won the 350cc class and finished third in the 500cc class, equalling
  the lap record. In 1958, Phillis and his wife sold everything and went to
  Europe, where they bought new 350cc and 500cc Manx Nortons. At Thruxton
  Phillis won the 350 and the 500 events and set a new 500cc lap record. He
  repeated this "double" at the Falkenberg circuit in Sweden, and was now
  regarded as one of the top privateers in Europe. In 1959, he entered the Isle
  of Man and took fifth in the 350cc Formula 1 but broke a con-rod in the last
  lap of the Junior TT. High winds and torrential rain made the Senior TT
  challenging and Tom finished in sixteenth place. Phillis was impressed with
  Honda's debut effort at the TT which resulted in Honda claiming 6th, 7th, 8th
  and 11th in the 125cc light weight class, as well as the Manufacturers' Team
  Award. In 1960 Phillis wrote a personal letter to Soichiro Honda and Soichiro
  responded by making Phillis a Honda works rider in February 1960. Another
  Aussie, Bob Brown was also sign to the team and Honda returned to the Isle of
  Man for 1960 with revised 125 twins and 16-valve 250 fours. Tom Phillis
  qualified second fastest for the Isle of Man 125cc race and ended the race in
  10th place. Over all Honda did well at the 1960 TT with their riders taking
  the 6th through 10th positions in the 125 race and 4th through 6th places in
  the 250cc category. Bob Brown's 4th in the 250 TT made him the first Westerner
  to score world championship points on a Japanese machine. Phillis would bring
  Honda it's first world championship race victory at Montjuich Parc, Barcelona
  on April 23, 1961 and Hondaâ€™s first GP double at Clermont-Ferrand, France on
  May 21.
