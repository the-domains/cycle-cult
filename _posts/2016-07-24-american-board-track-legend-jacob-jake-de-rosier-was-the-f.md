  American board track legend Jacob (Jake) De Rosier was the favorite to win the
  1911 Isle of Man TT, but after leading the first lap, he crashed several times
  and lost his tools and spares on the rough IOM course. Jake was forced to
  borrow a spark plug to complete the race and was disqualified for accepting
  help with repairs at his refueling station (a violation of the rules). Indian
  sponsored fivebikes in the 1911 Isle of Man TT races and even with De Rosier's
  disqualification Indian became the first foreign manufacturer to win the TT
  sweeping the top three positions in what would become known as the "Indian
  Massacre" at the Isle of Man. De Rosier was born in Quebec in 1880 and his
  family moved to the U.S. when he was four. De Rosier took up bicycle racing in
  his teens becoming one of the top racers in New England by 1897. Jake was
  fascinated with the bicycle pacing machines used at the velodromes of era. He
  befriended Henri Fournier the Frenchman responsible for introducing motor
  paced racing to the U.S. and was able convince Henri to let him pilot one of
  the machines. Fournier was impressed with Jake's skill at riding one of these
  beasts which was no small feat. De Rosier was hired by Fournier and became one
  of the best pacing riders in Paris and other tracks around the world. It was
  at an American velodrome that Jake met Oscar Hedström and was offered to ride
  for Indian, becoming one of the first factory-backed motorcycle racers. De
  Rosier started winning endurance runs and bicycle velodrome track races on an
  Indian and in 1908 he was the top rider in the Federation of American
  Motorcyclists (FAM). By the end of 1911 Jake held every FAM speed record for
  professional riders. De Rosier won nearly 900 races during his racing career
  and was undoubtedly the most famous motorcycle racer of the early 20th
  century. ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeRosier
