  On July 4th 1939, Noel Baddow Pope was timed at 137 mph over a flying
  half-mile at the infamous Brooklands concrete bowl. Pope's 998cc "8-80" type
  Brough Superior had twin-spark magnetos and an extra oil pump for the
  supercharger. Despite the Brooklands track being incredibly bumpy, Pope was
  able to lap the circuit on this rigid framed beast at an impressive 124.51
  mph! The J.A.P. engine used a chain-driven supercharger which had a separate
  shock absorber on the "blower" shaft. It used a Sturmey Archer three-speed
  gearbox.
