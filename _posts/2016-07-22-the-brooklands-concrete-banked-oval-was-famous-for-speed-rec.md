  The Brooklands concrete banked oval was famous for speed record attempts in
  the 1930's. In this photo taken on Friday October 27th in 1938 the 3 hour
  350cc record was being challenged on a Norton. The rider in the saddle is
  Howard Earle and standing behind him with a scarf on is legendary Norton tuner
  Francis Beart. Beart had been a regular competitor at the track until he
  opened a small shop on the circuit in 1937 and began tuning other riders
  machines as well as racing. It was an unusually cold day at the track and
  Brooklands veteran Noel Pope would alternate riding the Norton with Earle for
  this attempt. Earle would be the first rider and 50 laps into the effort the
  extra large fuel tank sprung a leak ending their efforts for the day. The next
  morning a second attempt was mustered this time with a standard racing tank
  fitted. The weather had improved some what but Earle was unable maintain the
  speeds achieved the previous day so Beart signaled him in and Pope took over.
  Noel Pope was able to increase the speed and get a record setting pace going
  until a misfire set in and lap times began to fall. Already at a disadvantage,
  the team would require an extra refueling stop do to the smaller fuel tank
  having been fitted. But as luck would have it a new spark plug fixed the
  problem and Pope was back on the track reaching even greater lap times. As the
  3 hour mark was reached a new average lap speed record of 93mph was set
  including pit stops! Pope came in exhausted from riding the rough concrete
  Brooklands surface on the hard tail Norton at full chat for more than 2 hours.
  Earle hopped into the saddle and went after the 500km record, breaking that as
  well. Francis Beart would become one of the best Norton Manx tuners every with
  bikes he prepared winning eleven GP wins, ten 2nd and 3 third place finishes.
  Beart's efforts were even felt in the USA, where Nortons he tuned won at
  Daytona for three years running 1949, 1950 and 1951.
