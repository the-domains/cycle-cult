  On October 21st 1937, between the 80th and 82nd kilometres of the
  Brescia-Bergamo stretch of motorway, Piero Taruffi’s Gilera Rondine covered
  the flying kilometer in just 13.13 seconds at a record-breaking speed of
  274.481 km/h (170.555 mph). In 1935 Taruffi had reached a speed of 244.5 km/h
  (151.925 mph) with an unfaired version of the Rondine and for this latest
  attempt he used the Caproni aircraft wind tunnel to develop a completely
  enclosed fairing. Taruffi was an engineer and the technical director at
  Gilera, Italy’s oldest motorcycle manufacturer, he would also become a top
  Formula One driver. The Rondine (Swallow) is considered the first motorcycle
  of the modern era. It was a water-cooled dohc 492cc 4-cylinder 4 stroke engine
  running on alcohol through Weber carburetors and a Roots supercharger.
