  The Vincent V-twin motorcycle incorporated a number of new and innovative
  ideas, some of which were more successful than others. The 998 cc 47.5° V
  Series A Rapide twin appeared in 1936 with 6.8:1 compression ratio, and
  produced 45 hp it was capable of 110 miles per hour. The high power meant that
  the Burman clutch and gearbox transmission did not cope well. The Series B
  Rapide designed during the war and released to the press before end of the
  war. The B series engines now had internal oil pipes, and the gearbox was part
  of the engine casting (Unit Construction). The angle between the cylinders was
  now 50° instead of the 47.5° of the Series A engine. This allowed the use of
  the engine as a stressed member of the frame, which consisted of an oil-tank
  spine with the engine hanging below, and the front and rear suspension
  attached at the ends. By 1950, the Series C featured a 998cc, 50-degree V-twin
  that put out between 45 and 55 horsepower, depending on the state of tune and
  the Black Shadow, was capable of 125 mph! Hence the slogan "the makers of the
  world's fastest motorcycles".
