  Charles ‘Chook’ Hodgekiss coupled two 500cc J.A.P. motors in tandem to create
  his distinctive sidecar speedway racers. Although the sidecar rig doesn't
  appear to be fitted in this photo I don't believe Chook ever raced solo on one
  of these contraption's. Douglas and Rudge motorcycles dominated speedway's
  formative years, before the arrival of the ‘Speedway JAP’ engine in 1930's.
  The J.A.P. was a proprietary engine, and as such available to every
  builder/racer. There was even one Aussie racer that built a Speedcar with 3
  JAP engines! In 1955 a 500cc JAP Speedway engine could be purchased for under
  100 £ ($156.00).  Photo via Steve Margo who got it from Barbara Keir "Ckook's"
