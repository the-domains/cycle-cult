  Paul Meunier won the French Grand Prix in 1921 on a OHV 350cc Zédel v-twin
  Alcyon motorcycle. Alcyon was founded by Edmond Gentil at Neuilly sur Seine in
  1902 to manufacture bicycles. In 1904 the factory assembled its first
  motorcycle, it was equipped with a Swiss Zedel single cylinder 350cc engine,
  from the firm of Zurcher & Luthi in St. Aubin. The Zédel name came from the
  initials of the two founders of the firm, Ernest Zürcher and Hermann Luthi.
  The company's main sales were made in France, so in 1905, the partners
  established a French subsidiary just over the border in Pontarlier to avoid
  customs duties. Alcyon was among the first motorcycle makers to use
  overhead-valves in their racing machines even four valves per cylinder as
  early as 1912. In 1912 Alcyon entered two machines in the Isle of Man TT races
  with 348cc single-cylinder engines that featured two inlet valves and two
  exhaust valves. Unfortunatelyly both bikes failed to finish the Junior TT
  race. Alcyon turned their factory over to repairing airplanes during WWI.
  After the war, their first model was a 1914 cc four-cylinder car which
  performed quite well in competition but didn't sell well. Alcyon eventually
  abandoned car production. This Alcyon motorcycle is fitted with a
  forward-mounted magneto by Thomann and Labor (two marques belonging to the
  Gentil group). The engine was lubricated by hand pumping the plunger fitted on
  the right side of the tank to get oil into the crankcase. What looks like a
  v-belt wheel sheave on the rear is actually a rear wheel brake. the French
  Zédel factory was purchased by Alcyon in 1907 and subsequently most Alcyon
  motorcycles would be equipped with Zédel engines with the exception of 1925
  when J.A.P. engines were also fitted in some models. After 1945 mostly light
  motorcycles, scooters and mopeds were produced, Peugeot took over the company
  in 1954.
