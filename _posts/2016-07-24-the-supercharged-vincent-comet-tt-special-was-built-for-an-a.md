  The supercharged Vincent Comet TT Special was built for an attempt to beat the
  Nortons at the 1936 TT races. Phil Irving the engineer and author famous for
  his work with Vincent and Velocette, met Philip Vincent just prior to the 1931
  British motorcycle show. Vincent offered Irving a job at his business in
  Stevenage alongside engineer E.J. Massey from the original HRD company. Irving
  also wrote atechnical column in Motor Cycling magazine under the pseudonym
  'Slide Rule' around this time. Phil worked on drawing up the TT's nickel
  cast-iron cylinder with finned aluminum jacket and designing an aluminum
  cylinder head and new camshaft. With a blower added it was hoped that the TT
  would output 35 to 45hp, but in the end the supercharged machine was too
  heavy, too thirsty, ran way too hot and couldn't beat the latest Nortons.
  While testing the machines prior to the TT the decision was made to convert
  them back to normally aspirated machines and in reflection Irving noted that
  if the time spent on supercharging the Comet had been directed at the normally
  aspirated machines the outcome at the tT might have been more successful. As
  it was the only Vincent rider to finish the race was Jock West who broke a
  primary chain in the last stretch and pushed his Comet across the finish line
  for a respectable 8th place all things considered. Irving would leave Vincent
  in 1937 to work at Velocette until 1942. He returned to Stevenage as Vincent's
  Chief Engineer in 1943 and he back to his native Australia in 1949, after the
  Vincent motorcycle business was put into receivership. ref: Phil Irving -
