  It's amazing to me that in the 1960's, the USSR ever attempted to compete in
  GP motorcycle competitions let alone build a unique double overhead cam
  4-stroke engine of their own design but that's what they did. The Soviet Union
  had entered a new era often called the "Era of Stagnation" under the rule of
  Leonid Brezhnev. The leadership set out to stabilize the Soviet economy and
  speed up growth with economic reforms. Needless to say motorcycle racing was
  probably low on the list of projects to undertake. But regardless the Central
  Construction and Experimental Department in Serpuchov (outside Moscow) was
  able to build a totally new GP racer designed by Russian engineer Evgenij
  Mathiushin. The motorcycle was inspired by several western machines most
  notably MV Agusta's dohc racers and the frame was similar to the Norton
  feather bed but the bike was all Russian. The 1964 Vostok S-364 sported a
  short stroke (49x46mm) engine with double overhead camshafts and 6-speed
  gearbox. USSR riders Nickolai Sevastyanov and Endel Kiisa competed in
  international grand prix events with the machine and did surprisingly well. In
  1965, Endel Kiisa surprised the racing world at the GP of Finland by taking
  third place, behind Jim Redman and Bruce Beale on Hondas. But the Vostok
  racers were often forced to retire early with mechanical problems often
  destroying pistons in the final lap. The government was never fully behind the
  team and even though there was modest success, funding was pulled on the
  project. In 1968 some new life was breathed into the Vostok GP effort and a
  new "S-565" was debuted to compete in senior events. The 494 cc machine had a
  strengthened frame and a new head with three valves for each cylinder and was
  said to put out 80hp. At the 1968 GP in Finland, Nickolai Sevastyanov managed
  to finish in fourth place behind Agostini, Findlay and Marsowszki. 1969 was
  the last year for the Vostok racers and they only competed in one race in East
  Germany taking tenth place.
