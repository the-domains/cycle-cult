  Talk about a bum deal, at the 1926 Lightweight TT Race newcomer Pietro Ghersi
  came in second place in the junior but was disqualified for using a different
  sparkplug in the engine of his Moto Guzzi than the one that was in it at
  pre-race inspection! Pietro also set the fastest lap of 63.12mph. Jimmy
  Simpson on an AJS motorcycle produced the first 70 mph lap, with a time of 32
  minutes and 9 seconds an average speed of 70.43 mph. Pietro and his brother
  Mario Ghersi and Luigi Arcangeli were the first Italian riders at the Isle of
  Man TT in 1926. Arcangeli rode a Bianchi to 14th place in the Junior TT. Luigi
  returned to the Isle of Man in 1927 contesting both the Senior TT and the
  Lightweight TT riding a Moto Guzzi, he could only manage 14th in the Senior
  race but took a fine second in the Lightweight.
