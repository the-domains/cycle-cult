  Ansani's W3 Fan engine proved to be a wild success after his 25 hp,
  three-cylinder 6.4-liter was chosen by Louis Blériot for his historic flight
  across the English Cannel. Anzani had actually secretly tested the engine in a
  flight over Lake Maggiore piloted by Enrico Forlanini, an engineer and pioneer
  of Italian aviation. Ansani would later offer 6 different Fan type engines and
  by December 1909an Ansani 3 cylinder "Y" type radial engine. The symmetric
  120° three-cylinder Y type arrangement eliminated the need for a counterweight
  considerably reducing the weight. It should be noted that one advantage of the
  fan configuration was that, because all the cylinders were above the
  horizontal line the plugs were less likely to be fouled by the lubricating
  oil. His 3.1 litre (186 cu in) Y type unit produced 22 kW (30 hp) at 1,300
  rpm. The Y type configuration led, to Anzani's development of two-row radial
  engines, beginning with the 6-cyl radials, two Ys on a common crankshaft.
