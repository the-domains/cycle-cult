  Noel Pope's 1949 attempt at a new world land speed record wasn't just about
  breaking Ernst Henne's 1937, 173 mph record. This was about reclaiming the
  record for England from the Germans now that war time restrictions were
  relaxed. 'The Motor Cycle' magazine offered a trophy and £500 to the first
  British rider on an all-British motorcycle to gain the official motorcycle
  speed record. The J.A.P engined Brough Superior could produce 120 bhp with a
  blower where as Ernest Henne's BMW only made 78 bhp. Blackburn and General
  Aircraft would design the streamlined aluminum shell for the machine and
  including Noel Pope the machine only weighted 650 pounds. George Brough
  himself would accompany Noel Pope to Bonneville. The bike, body shell and
  spares were packed into crates and shipped to New York to be forwarded to Utah
  by rail. A screw-up at US Customs delayed the crates for 10 days and when they
  finally arrived the body work was damaged and last minute repairs were
  attempted to straighten out the body panels as best they could. Surprising few
  photographs of the event exist considering the potential importance if the
  record were to be broken. This photo was taken by none other than Rollie Free
  who in September of 1948 had set the US national motorcycle speed record of
  150.313 mph (241.905 km/h) on an un-faired Vincent HRD motorcycle. Sadly Noel
  Pope and the "Silver Fish" as it would be come known would only reach 150 mph
  on the salt before crashing. Miraculously Pope walked away from the wreckage
  without serious injury.  photo ref: Rollie Free photo from "Flat Out! The
