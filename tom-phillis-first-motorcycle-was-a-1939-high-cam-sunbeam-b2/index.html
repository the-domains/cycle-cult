Phillis began racing a Velocette MAC in Junior Clubman events around 1953. In 1955 his wife Betty helped him buy a BSA Gold Star and he started to get serious about racing. His next machine was this two year old Manx Norton that he is standing next to in this photo taken at Fishermans Bend, an old airfield circuit in Melbourne. Phillis won the 350cc class and finished third in the 500cc class, equalling the lap record. In 1958, Phillis and his wife sold everything and went to Europe, where they bought new 350cc and 500cc Manx Nortons. At Thruxton Phillis won the 350 and the 500 events and set a new 500cc lap record. He repeated this "double" at the Falkenberg circuit in Sweden, and was now regarded as one of the top privateers in Europe. In 1959, he entered the Isle of Man and took fifth in the 350cc Formula 1 but broke a con-rod in the last lap of the Junior TT. High winds and torrential rain made the Senior TT challenging and Tom finished in sixteenth place. Phillis was impressed with Honda's debut effort at the TT which resulted in Honda claiming 6th, 7th, 8th and 11th in the 125cc light weight class, as well as the Manufacturers' Team Award. In 1960 Phillis wrote a personal letter to Soichiro Honda and Soichiro responded by making Phillis a Honda works rider in February 1960. Another Aussie, Bob Brown was also sign to the team and Honda returned to the Isle of Man for 1960 with revised 125 twins and 16-valve 250 fours. Tom Phillis qualified second fastest for the Isle of Man 125cc race and ended the race in 10th place. Over all Honda did well at the 1960 TT with their riders taking the 6th through 10th positions in the 125 race and 4th through 6th places in the 250cc category. Bob Brown's 4th in the 250 TT made him the first Westerner to score world championship points on a Japanese machine. Phillis would bring Honda it's first world championship race victory at Montjuich Parc, Barcelona on April 23, 1961 and Hondaâ€™s first GP double at Clermont-Ferrand, France on May 21.</p><p>Photo credit: Charles Rice</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>

Over all Honda did well at the 1960 TT with their riders taking the 6th through 10th positions in the 125 race and 4th through 6th places in the 250cc category. Bob Brown's 4th in the 250 TT made him the first Westerner to score world championship points on a Japanese machine. Phillis would bring Honda it's first world championship race victory at Montjuich Parc, Barcelona on April 23, 1961 and Hondaâ€™s first GP double at Clermont-Ferrand, France on May 21."},{"id":"c474f621-7845-4fb4-abf9-14e438ed5d50","item":"14c288a4-03e7-4e86-b55b-f1eb06d36523","type":"text","html":"<p>Photo credit: Charles Rice</p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true},"text":"Photo credit: Charles Rice"}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":2,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"Cycle Cult RSS","type":"application/rss+xml"}}}]}},"sections":[{"componentId":"ArticleFallback","itemsToRenderIds":["14c288a4-03e7-4e86-b55b-f1eb06d36523"],"contracts":{"the-beautician":{"$item_index":1,"sectionsBeautyverse":{"section-height":{"$class":["section-height-fullscreen"]},"text-align":{"$class":["text-align-left"]},"group-order":{"$class":["group-order-normal"]},"group-graphical-shape":{"$class":["group-graphical-shape-none"]}},"$class":["group-graphical-shape-none","group-order-normal","text-align-left","section-height-fullscreen","site:w-multiple-item","hero-transition-none","section-v-padding-medium","section-h-padding-large","Vignelli","14c288a4-03e7-4e86-b55b-f1eb06d36523","item:dont-cover-filter","item:dont-cover-crop","item:dont-cover-overlay","item:w-cover-face","item:w-cover-saliency","item:w-cover-portrait","item:w-cover-medium-res","item:w-cover-full-mobile-res","ArticleFallback"]},"the-colorist":{"$item_index":1,"colorverse":{"colors-solution":{"$class":["colors-dark"]},"colors-locality":{"$class":["colors-global"]}},"$class":["colors-global","colors-dark","site:colors-global","site:colors-light"],"colorsSolution":{"isLight":false,"isDark":true,"lightnessClass":"is-dark","base":{"r":97,"g":20,"b":39},"bg":{"r":36,"g":20,"b":24},"box":{"r":40,"g":21,"b":26},"boxShadow":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.3},"boxPop":{"r":221,"g":220,"b":197},"boxPopText":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxPop2":{"r":106,"g":106,"b":97},"boxPop2Text":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"boxPopTextHover":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxPop2TextHover":{"r":204,"g":204,"b":204},"boxPopMostVibrant":{"r":226,"g":54,"b":97},"boxPopMostVibrantText":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"selectionText":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"selection":{"r":226,"g":54,"b":97,"a":0.5},"header":{"r":39,"g":21,"b":25},"zebraStripe":{"r":43,"g":24,"b":29},"line":{"r":56,"g":38,"b":43},"mediaBorder":{"css":"1px solid hsl(343, 19%, 18%)","width":1,"type":"solid","color":{"r":56,"g":38,"b":43}},"mediaShadowColor":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.4},"mediaInsetColor":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255,"a":0.1},"mediaShadows":[{"css":"0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)","x":0,"y":1,"blur":2,"color":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.4},"inset":false},{"css":"inset 0 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)","x":0,"y":1,"blur":1,"color":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255,"a":0.1},"inset":true}],"title":{"r":236,"g":236,"b":223},"title2":{"r":177,"g":172,"b":164},"subTitle":{"r":101,"g":88,"b":91},"text":{"r":241,"g":243,"b":244},"text2":{"r":181,"g":176,"b":179},"textShadow":{"r":20,"g":11,"b":13,"a":0.5},"textShadowProps":{"color":{"r":20,"g":11,"b":13,"a":0.5},"x":0,"y":1,"blur":0},"textPop":{"r":149,"g":137,"b":118},"textPop2":{"r":106,"g":106,"b":97},"meta":{"r":101,"g":88,"b":91},"metaHover":{"r":117,"g":102,"b":106},"icon":{"r":149,"g":137,"b":118},"iconSelected":{"r":149,"g":137,"b":118},"iconOver":{"r":149,"g":137,"b":118},"palette":[{"r":221,"g":220,"b":197},{"r":149,"g":137,"b":118},{"r":97,"g":20,"b":39},{"r":29,"g":35,"b":38},{"r":106,"g":106,"b":97}]}},"the-lensman":{"filter":{"$class":["passthrough"],"graph":"passthrough","config":null}},"itemsClasses":["14c288a4-03e7-4e86-b55b-f1eb06d36523","item:dont-cover-filter","item:dont-cover-crop","item:dont-cover-overlay","item:w-cover-face","item:w-cover-saliency","item:w-cover-portrait","item:w-cover-medium-res","item:w-cover-full-mobile-res"],"siteClasses":["site:w-multiple-item","hero-transition-none","section-v-padding-medium","section-h-padding-large","Vignelli","site:colors-global","site:colors-light"],"componentClasses":["ArticleFallback"]},"sectionIndex":0}],"contracts":{"the-typographer":{"typography":{"fonts":{"display":{"foundry":"google","family":"Merriweather Sans","name":"Merriweather Sans","normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.4545454545454546,"$type":["sans","humanist"],"$weight":2,"$width":2,"$xheight":2,"$contrast":1,"$caps":"normal","$numbers":"lining","license":"ofl","description":"Merriweather Sans is a low-contrast semi-condensed sans-serif text typeface\nfamily designed to be pleasant to read at very small sizes.
