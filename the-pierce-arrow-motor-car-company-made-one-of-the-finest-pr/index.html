Pierce also manufactured some innovative motorcycles and bicycles. The first Pierce bicycle appeared in 1890 and they started manufacturing automobiles in 1901. In 1906 the Pierce Cycle Company led by George N. Pierce's son, Percy would become a separate enterprise. Percy Pierce acquired a Belgian FN Four cylinder motorcycle in 1908 and brought it to America to disassemble and study. The FN Four's engine was designed by Paul Kelecom who had designed single cylinder engines prior to the FN. Using the FN as "reference" the Pierce design department spent the next two years developing the innovative Pierce Four. Large diameter tubing was used and the engine became a stressed member of the frame construction. The frame also held oil and gasoline internally and concealed the control cables. The Pierce Four had a T-head, and cam-driven intake valves and was shaft driven. By 1910 a two-speed transmission was offered and the company also offered a single cylinder model which was belt driven. Pierce bicycles had since 1900 offered a chainless shaft drive system and other innovations like the Cushion Frame launched in 1898 which featured a shock absorber on the post connecting the rear axle to the seat pillar and sprung forks in 1903. The Pierce Bicycles were endorsed by 16 time national bicycle champion Frank Kramer. The company slogan "Tried &amp; True" appeared on all their advertising material. The Pierce Four motorcycle is said to have cost more to build than its sale price and eventually bankrupted Pierce Motorcycle Company after fewer than 500 were built. The last Pierce Motorcycle was produced in 1914, bicycles would remain in production at the original Buffalo, NY factory until 1918. That same year the Emblem Manufacturing Company in Angola, NY purchased the bicycle business and would continue to manufacture a Pierce bicycle line until 1940. The Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company went under in 1938. This photo is of H. L. Wilkens &amp; Co.'s Pierce dealership at 1082 Bedford avenue in Brooklyn NY.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
