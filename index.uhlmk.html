sold more than $125 million worth of Knievel toys. Always the promoter, in the 1960&#x27;s Evel owned a Honda auto dealership and any potential buyer who could beat Knievel at arm-wrestling got $500 off their car purchase (now that&#x27;s a salesman!). The &quot;Strato-Cycle&quot; was produced to tie-in with the &quot;Viva Knievel&quot; movie featuring Evel Knievel himself. Apparently he rode this motorcycle in the movie although I don&#x27;t remember the movie I do recall having the toy. And now after researching the photo I wish I still had the toy, it is super collectable and trading for around a thousand dollars!

Columbus was near a rail line and received Confederate casualties of war. By the end of the war 2,500 Confederate soldiers are thought to have been buried in Friendship Cemetery along with, 32 Union soldiers. The women felt moved to honor the Union soldiers buried there by decorating their graves as well. A Yale graduate and poet Francis Miles Finch, heard about the gesture of humanity and reconciliation by the women of Columbus and wrote a tribute poem to soldiers from both sides. The poem called "The Blue and the Gray" was published in the September, 1867 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. In 1868, the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans established "Decoration Day" as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers. By the 20th century, Union and Confederate holiday traditions which were celebrated on different days, merged to become "Memorial Day" to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. An American flag is placed on each of their graves in national cemeteries by volunteers on the last Monday of May. Remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="109"><!-- react-empty: 110 --></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="111"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="112"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f2424733-f6ef-4486-a7af-3a4e6d856ad9.jpg" alt="Harley-Davidson WLA  &quot;Liberator&quot;"><p>The classic Harley-Davidson WLA or "Liberator" as it became known, was the main motorcycle used by the U.S. armed forces in WWII. In 1939 the Army was looking for a motorcycle better suited for military use than the standard civilian models. Harley-Davidson, Indian and even the Delco division of General Motors competed to develop motorcycles that had better ground clearance and off-road mobility and could carry a fully equipped soldier in adverse conditions. The Army’s use of motorcycles dated back to the First World War, when it acquired over 20,000 Harley-Davidsons and Indians to be used by messengers, military police engaged in traffic control, and for general purpose transportation. By 1940 the Army was considering using motorcycles as reconnaissance vehicles in the mechanized cavalry and was conducting field tests. But truth be told, motorcycles were extremely vulnerable on the battlefield and performed poorly off road. By 1943 most WLAs were replaced by Jeeps with the exception of police and dispatch riders who had less need to carry heavy loads of weapons and ammunition. Harley-Davidson produced a total of 57,565 WLAs during WWII of which 60 percent went to Allied forces as part of a Lend-Lease military assistance program.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="113"><!-- react-empty: 114 --></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="115"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="116"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="117"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="118"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="119"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3e1586ba1122248836f90ccea0381d84/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0615af0e-e8df-45d2-9187-58a96c52c025.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:76.89393939393939% 34.215500945179585%;" data-reactid="120"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3e1586ba1122248836f90ccea0381d84/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0615af0e-e8df-45d2-9187-58a96c52c025.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:76.89393939393939% 34.215500945179585%;" data-reactid="121"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/989a54aeb6d711a1fe101f39ebce874a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0615af0e-e8df-45d2-9187-58a96c52c025.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:76.89393939393939% 34.215500945179585%;" data-reactid="122"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/611d1e835d20e674056b7c1ea9955642/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0615af0e-e8df-45d2-9187-58a96c52c025.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:76.89393939393939% 34.215500945179585%;" data-reactid="123"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="529" data-ratio="1.4971644612476371" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3e1586ba1122248836f90ccea0381d84/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0615af0e-e8df-45d2-9187-58a96c52c025.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:76.89393939393939% 34.215500945179585%;" data-reactid="124"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="125"><!-- react-empty: 126 --><div class="" data-reactid="127"><!-- react-text: 128 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m " data-reactid="129"><p data-reactid="130">WWII United States Army Indians</p></div><!-- react-empty: 131 --><!-- react-empty: 132 --><!-- react-empty: 133 --></div><!-- react-empty: 134 --><!-- react-empty: 135 --><!-- react-empty: 136 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="137"><p data-reactid="138">The United States Army used Indian Chiefs, Scouts, and Junior Scouts for various purposes in small numbers during WWII but none of these could unseat the Harley-Davidson WLA as the Army&#x27;s main motorcycle. The early Indian Scout 640 competed directly with Harley&#x27;s WLA but the 750 cc (46 cu in) was too expensive and heavy. Indian&#x27;s 500 cc (31 cu in) 741B shown in this 1942 photo was their best offering but it was underpowered and failed to gain a US Military contract for the company. Indian also offered a version based on the 1,200 cc (73 cu in) Chief, the 344. Also approximately 1,056 copies of the 841, an experimental motorcycle with a 750 cc motor mounted sideways in the frame with a shaft drive similar to a modern Moto Guzzi were also built but also failed to be adopted for wider military use. The Indian 841 was heavily inspired by the BMW R71 motorcycle, as was its competitor, the Harley-Davidson XA which was basically a copy.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="139"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="140"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9baaf28a-f460-4108-bb42-8c659dcd9e07.jpg" alt="Gary Hocking on the 250 MV"><p>A great shot of Gary Hocking on the 250 MV at the Ulster Grand Prix in 1960. In the spring of 1960 Gary campaigned a private Norton at the races in South Africa and won the South African Championship in the 500cc class. MV Agusta offered Hocking full factory support for the 1960 season riding in the 125, 250 and 350cc classes for the World Cup and he repaid them by finishing 2nd in all three classes. At the 1960 Isle of Man Gary was the winner of the five-lap Lightweight race, leading throughout in front of another all-Italian battle between Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio Provini. In 1961, Hocking became MV Agusta's top rider and went on to claim dual World Championships in the 350cc and 500cc classes. At the 1962 Isle of Man Hocking slammed into the back of another Rhodesian, Graham Smith, at about 120 mph on a bend during practice. Hocking's MV burst into flames, but he was thrown clear, escaping with cuts and bruises, while Smith suffered a fractured hip. A TT official who witnessed the crash said "It is incredible both riders are alive." A crash like that would have deterred a lesser man from competing and in fact as he wheeled his MV to the start of the Senior TT, Gary left behind a promise to his parents that, win or lose, this would be his last race. On the second of the six laps, Hocking gave an incredible display of cornering and opened a fifteen-second gap on Hailwood, shattering the lap record of 105,75 mph in the process. He took the checkered flag, covering the 226,4 miles in 2 hr. 11 min. 14 sec. at a record average speed of 103,51 mph. Hocking kept his word, and after his Senior TT success, announced his retirement. Unfortunately just six months later he died at the age of twenty-five in an ambulance on the way to Addington Hospital, after crashing his Lotus Climax V8 car at Westmead, Durban, while practicing for the Natal Grand Prix.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="141"><!-- react-empty: 142 --></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="143"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="144"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="145"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="146"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="147"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/39ca0c8889fc8846c76fad0bf1e477e2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85dca885-6ee3-497a-9d12-6342216335f7.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:91.79292929292929% 39.243027888446214%;" data-reactid="148"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/39ca0c8889fc8846c76fad0bf1e477e2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85dca885-6ee3-497a-9d12-6342216335f7.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:91.79292929292929% 39.243027888446214%;" data-reactid="149"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f43639df58a3d7b1f65bcc998b836e32/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85dca885-6ee3-497a-9d12-6342216335f7.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:91.79292929292929% 39.243027888446214%;" data-reactid="150"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/23ad4288d37167f0821f6d8c68b9a8a9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85dca885-6ee3-497a-9d12-6342216335f7.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:91.79292929292929% 39.243027888446214%;" data-reactid="151"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="502" data-ratio="1.5776892430278884" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/39ca0c8889fc8846c76fad0bf1e477e2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85dca885-6ee3-497a-9d12-6342216335f7.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:91.79292929292929% 39.243027888446214%;" data-reactid="152"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="153"><!-- react-empty: 154 --><div class="" data-reactid="155"><!-- react-text: 156 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m " data-reactid="157"><p data-reactid="158">Gary Hocking at the 1960 French GP</p></div><!-- react-empty: 159 --><!-- react-empty: 160 --><!-- react-empty: 161 --></div><!-- react-empty: 162 --><!-- react-empty: 163 --><!-- react-empty: 164 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="165"><p data-reactid="166">This photo of Gary Hocking at the 1960 French motorcycle Grand Prix doesn&#x27;t look like it is going to end well.

some people Evel Knievel was the \"Worlds Greatest Stuntman\" while others see a legendary showman that sold more than $125 million worth of Knievel toys. Always the promoter, in the 1960's Evel owned a Honda auto dealership and any potential buyer who could beat Knievel at arm-wrestling got $500 off their car purchase (now that's a salesman!). The \"Strato-Cycle\" was produced to tie-in with the \"Viva Knievel\" movie featuring Evel Knievel himself.

Columbus was near a rail line and received Confederate casualties of war. By the end of the war 2,500 Confederate soldiers are thought to have been buried in Friendship Cemetery along with, 32 Union soldiers. The women felt moved to honor the Union soldiers buried there by decorating their graves as well. A Yale graduate and poet Francis Miles Finch, heard about the gesture of humanity and reconciliation by the women of Columbus and wrote a tribute poem to soldiers from both sides. The poem called \"The Blue and the Gray\" was published in the September, 1867 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. In 1868, the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans established \"Decoration Day\" as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers.

In the spring of 1960 Gary campaigned a private Norton at the races in South Africa and won the South African Championship in the 500cc class. MV Agusta offered Hocking full factory support for the 1960 season riding in the 125, 250 and 350cc classes for the World Cup and he repaid them by finishing 2nd in all three classes. At the 1960 Isle of Man Gary was the winner of the five-lap Lightweight race, leading throughout in front of another all-Italian battle between Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio Provini. In 1961, Hocking became MV Agusta's top rider and went on to claim dual World Championships in the 350cc and 500cc classes. At the 1962 Isle of Man Hocking slammed into the back of another Rhodesian, Graham Smith, at about 120 mph on a bend during practice. Hocking's MV burst into flames, but he was thrown clear, escaping with cuts and bruises, while Smith suffered a fractured hip.
