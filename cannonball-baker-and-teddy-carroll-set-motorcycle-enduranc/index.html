The 2 mile wooden oval track was located north of Cincinnati between Crescentville and Mosteller roads in Sharonville. The track opened September 4, 1916 and was a copy of the Chicago Speedway Park with a wooden surface 60 feet wide on the homestretch, 70 feet wide in the turns and 50 feet wide on the backstretch. The turns were banked at 19 degrees and reached 33 degrees at the very top. By 1917 the world was at war and the big three motorcycle involved in racing (Harley Davidson, Indian and Excelsior) had signed an agreement to suspend support for racing until the end of WWI. Factory support was still available for endurance runs and sanctioned speed challenges. Just four weeks prior Red Pankhurst riding for Harley Davidson had set new records and Cannonball Baker and Indian were determined to retake the 24 hour record. WWI was in full swing and the First Ohio Regiment under Colonel Galbraith, some 1,500 soldier were encamped at the track and I'm sure eager to watch the attempt. Baker would go after the 12 and 24 hour solo records and Teddy Carroll and George Von Staden would attack the sidecar records both would also set 500 and 1000 mile records. Both machines were on the track at the same time and three stops were made during the first 500 miles. The track was especially dangerous at night with very little lighting and close to midnight it started raining making the wood surface extremely slippery. The rain forced Baker to ride without googles and a bug struck him in the left eye. Not being able to see well Baker mis-judged a turn and slammed into the guard rail sending him and his machine sliding across the track for two hundred feet at 60 miles an hour. Luckily the bike suffered only a broken footboard and Baker was walked over to the First Regiments field hospital where his eye was attended to and he suffered only a bruised shoulder and some abrasions. Teddy and George pulled off the track as well and both machines were equipped with new lights. They were back on the track and back at it in 23 and a half minutes. By 2 o'clock the rain finally stopped and the men really started to pick-up speed again. The 1000 mile mark was reached at 16:14:15 on the solo and at 18:48:30 for the sidecar. It was a big boost for the Hendee factory and Indian touted the records in their advertising with pride. The last racing event held at the Cincinnati Speedway was a 48 hour endurance race for Essex Automobiles held in December of 1919. The Speedway was abandoned and dismantled with the lumber shipped to Chillicothe, Ohio to be used in the construction of Camp Sherman, one of the new training camps for the War effort. The camp was built on top of Hopewell Native American mounds in the area which were bulldozed to make way for the 1,370 buildings constructed at Camp Sherman. The camp also housed German prisoners of war, POWs remained at Camp Sherman until September 1919, several months after the war had ended.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
