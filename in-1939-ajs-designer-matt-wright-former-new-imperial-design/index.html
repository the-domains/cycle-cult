The earlier air cooled design while incredibly fast had serious over heating issues. The new twin overhead cam engine was water cooled with beautiful alloy barrels and cylinder heads cast in pairs, and fitted with enclosed valves. The exhaust ports now exited from the rear on the new design and to further aid cooling an impeller type water pump was added to the left side of the crankshaft. A radiator was mounted on each side of the front frame down tubes and the supercharger boost was reduced to 6 psi. The first outing was to be at the North West 200 piloted by Bob Foster but it flooded and failed to fire on the starting line. Two machines were entered in the 1939 Isle of Man TT, ridden by Walter Rusk and Foster. At 405 lbs they were the heaviest machines entered in the TT. But it was the supercharged BMW's of Georg Meir and Jock West that grabbed the first two places. Rusk and Foster would come in 11th and 13th.</p><p>The last GP race before the outbreak of WWII was Ulster with both the V-4's entered. Foster and Rusk led the race at the start but Foster was forced to retire with a foaled plug in the first lap. Rusk had a 34 second lead at the end of the first lap and a record breaking average speed of 100.03 mph (160.98 km/h). But on his third lap (of 14) Rusk was also forced to retire when linkage on the girder fork broke (that must have been exciting). After the war in June 1946, the AJS V4 finally won, at Chimay in Belgium, ridden by Jock M West, Walter Rusk did not survive the War, and Jock's machine was the bike Rusk had ridden. A week later at Albi, France, Jock West was in the lead when a the crankpin seized and locked. The AJS supercharged "Porcupine" was in development to replace the aging V-4's but just three months after the Albi race, the FIM banned supercharging.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
