features a great photo of some "Hare Scrambles". At first glance the spectators in the upper right looked like leaves on a tree branch to me. I then noticed the course chalk outlines in the upper left and dispensed with the idea that it was a hill climb event. Scrambles, you say? Yeah, before Motocross and fundamentally different thanTrials competitions, Scrambles were off-road races around a marked course over rough terrain. The overall winner is the rider who maintains the highest speed throughout the race, unlike Trials where delicate balancing and strict scoring are the measure of excellence. We can probably thank scrambles for early developments in suspension and the rear swing arm. I can only imagine what running a Scramble on a rigid frame motorcycle does to a man. The Honda CL77 or Scrambler 305 was the off-road or scrambler version of the Honda C77 Dream and the CB77 Super Hawk of the 1960s.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-7a1b9a7d-9d1a-4b1a-b315-31a18df68e96" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="45"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="46"><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1c5b74fc7573410e577644fd87b94d6b/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=371&cropwidth=792&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F591cbea9-267f-4ef8-81ac-0bad5560e323.jpg&x=0&y=64"
    alt="Supercharged Vincent Comet TT Special"><p>The supercharged Vincent Comet TT Special was built for an attempt to beat the Nortons at the 1936 TT races. Phil Irving the engineer and author famous for his work with Vincent and Velocette, met Philip Vincent just prior to the 1931 British motorcycle
    show. Vincent offered Irving a job at his business in Stevenage alongside engineer E.J. Massey from the original HRD company. Irving also wrote atechnical column in Motor Cycling magazine under the pseudonym 'Slide Rule' around this time. Phil worked
    on drawing up the TT's nickel cast-iron cylinder with finned aluminum jacket and designing an aluminum cylinder head and new camshaft. With a blower added it was hoped that the TT would output 35 to 45hp, but in the end the supercharged machine was
    too heavy, too thirsty, ran way too hot and couldn't beat the latest Nortons. While testing the machines prior to the TT the decision was made to convert them back to normally aspirated machines and in reflection Irving noted that if the time spent
    on supercharging the Comet had been directed at the normally aspirated machines the outcome at the tT might have been more successful. As it was the only Vincent rider to finish the race was Jock West who broke a primary chain in the last stretch
    and pushed his Comet across the finish line for a respectable 8th place all things considered. Irving would leave Vincent in 1937 to work at Velocette until 1942. He returned to Stevenage as Vincent's Chief Engineer in 1943 and he back to his native
    Australia in 1949, after the Vincent motorcycle business was put into receivership.<br>ref: Phil Irving - Autobiography</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="47"><!-- react-empty: 48 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumnLarge-3d01a276-2f97-4d06-a995-2c7fd6d3e2d3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="49"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ls-w-33p" data-reactid="51"><a class=" " href="photo-the-dunwoody-collection-bob-dunwoody" data-reactid="52"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="53"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="54"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b98fe78b9fff2d7d3db1f240ffa13eba/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcbaaa7c1-7145-4e45-803b-6b1ee6c3d605.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:5.166666666666667% 5.681818181818182%;" data-reactid="55"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b98fe78b9fff2d7d3db1f240ffa13eba/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcbaaa7c1-7145-4e45-803b-6b1ee6c3d605.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:5.166666666666667% 5.681818181818182%;" data-reactid="56"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b98fe78b9fff2d7d3db1f240ffa13eba/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcbaaa7c1-7145-4e45-803b-6b1ee6c3d605.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:5.166666666666667% 5.681818181818182%;" data-reactid="57"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d255aa6baef8839577db455609ba853a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcbaaa7c1-7145-4e45-803b-6b1ee6c3d605.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:5.166666666666667% 5.681818181818182%;" data-reactid="58"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="600" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.7575757575757576" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b98fe78b9fff2d7d3db1f240ffa13eba/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcbaaa7c1-7145-4e45-803b-6b1ee6c3d605.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:5.166666666666667% 5.681818181818182%;" data-reactid="59"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column ls-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ls-p-h-8 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="60"><!-- react-empty: 61 --><!-- react-empty: 62 --><!-- react-empty: 63 --><!-- react-empty: 64 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="65"><!-- react-text: 66 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="67"><p data-reactid="68">Sammy Miller - 1957 Ulster Grand Prix</p></div><a class=" " href="photo-the-dunwoody-collection-bob-dunwoody" data-reactid="69"><!-- react-empty: 70 --></a><!-- react-empty: 71 --><!-- react-empty: 72 --></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="73"><p>Terry Hill shown here talking to Sammy Miller at the 1957 Ulster Grand Prix was the owner of an NSU dealership in Northern Ireland. In 1956 Terry had acquired a 250 NSU Sportmax racer from the racing department in Germany and offered Sammy his first works ride. In his first race with the Sportmax, the North West 200, Sammy broke the track record on the machine and won the 250cc, not a bad debut with a new ride. In 1957 he won the 250cc North West 200 again with the NSU. In the 125cc Ultra-Lightweight TT he was fourth with a Mondial and in the 250cc Lightweight TT fifth, also with and Mondial. In the 1957 World Cup , he was third in the 250cc class. He won the 1958 250cc North West 200 again with the NSU and in the Ultra-Lightweight TT he came in fourth on a Ducati and in the Lightweight TT took fifth with a CZ . In 1958 he also began focusing his efforts on Trials competitions, eventually winning eleven British titles in the sport. He also won nine gold medals in the International Six Days Trial (ISDT) and he was European champion twice! Since 1964 Sammy and his wife Rosemary have operated the Sammy Miller motor museum in New Milton. There are over 300 motorcycles on display many of which are original works machines and prototypes. Included in the collection are an original sterile AJS E90 Porcupine, Geoff Duke's Gilera 500 4C and a Verdel with a radial engine. Sammy Miller was one of the best trial riders of all time.<br>Photo: the Dunwoody Collection ( Bob Dunwoody)</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-2373a21d-b59f-4d56-9660-683ed6c44929" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="74"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="75"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="76"><a class=" " href="talk-about-a-bum-deal-at-the-1926-lightweight-tt-race-newco" data-reactid="77"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="78"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="79"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/401d5706f208e3bcb0da312c1f17e47a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a28094f-4552-43f7-95ac-a412d64d2c4d.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:46.33838383838384% 20.86553323029366%;" data-reactid="80"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/401d5706f208e3bcb0da312c1f17e47a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a28094f-4552-43f7-95ac-a412d64d2c4d.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:46.33838383838384% 20.86553323029366%;" data-reactid="81"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3e014873cb7e21e5e1a9c40ac44d9a88/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a28094f-4552-43f7-95ac-a412d64d2c4d.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:46.33838383838384% 20.86553323029366%;" data-reactid="82"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cde98fe5daa73cc6b791a9aa9da462a7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a28094f-4552-43f7-95ac-a412d64d2c4d.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:46.33838383838384% 20.86553323029366%;" data-reactid="83"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="647" data-ratio="1.224111282843895" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/401d5706f208e3bcb0da312c1f17e47a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a28094f-4552-43f7-95ac-a412d64d2c4d.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:46.33838383838384% 20.86553323029366%;" data-reactid="84"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="85"><!-- react-empty: 86 --><!-- react-empty: 87 --><!-- react-empty: 88 --><!-- react-empty: 89 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="90"><!-- react-text: 91 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="92"><p data-reactid="93">Pietro Ghersi</p></div><a class=" " href="talk-about-a-bum-deal-at-the-1926-lightweight-tt-race-newco" data-reactid="94"><!-- react-empty: 95 --></a><!-- react-empty: 96 --><!-- react-empty: 97 --></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="98"><p>Talk about a bum deal, at the 1926 Lightweight TT Race newcomer Pietro Ghersi came in second place in the junior but was disqualified for using a different sparkplug in the engine of his Moto Guzzi than the one that was in it at pre-race inspection!

Mignon (Moto Mignon Modena) was an Italian motorcycle manufacturer designed and built in Modena by Vittorio Guerzoni, in collaboration with Vittorio Caiumi and later with Vittorio Bellentani. Initially they produced a 123 cc clip-on engine for bicycles, but also motorcycles in 1925 including a 246 cc parallel twin-side door with an electric sump. He was designing 4-stroke engines in a field then dominated by 2-strokes. The single-cylinder engine was a 123 cc opposed valve , two-speed gear box with chain drive. In 1932 Vittorio Guerzoni was commissioned by Enzo Ferrari (when his team ran a racing car and motorcycle) a 498 cc bevel driven overhead cam racing engine. Mignon's first dohc 500 single had two timing chains one for each camshaft.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GhostedColumn-f3fb2c90-2781-4aa8-8bb9-dc15d4504178" class="Section

flag is Enzo Ferrari. At the far right is Francesco Stanguellini next to his son Vittorio (in the shorts) who would take control of the Stanguellini brand at 19 years old when his father dies unexpectedly. the Scuderia Stanguellini team rider on Vittorio's left is Bezzant riding a Mignon. In 1931 Enzo Ferrari approached Vittorio Guerzoni at Mignon about developing an new racing motorcycle for the Ferrari race team. A racing Norton 'International' was purchased and disassembled so Mignon engineer Vittorio Bellentani could create a shaft-and-bevel single cylinder ohc engine similar the Norton with unit-construction engine and four-speed gearbox. But the prototype machine didn't prove to be as worthy as the British bike so the project was abandoned. Vittorio Bellentani would later in 1940, design the very first Ferrari racing the '815'.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-9afd5ea5-9d08-4c92-a5af-dc022118272f" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="182"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="183"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="184"><a class=" " href="the-vincent-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-with-the-fir" data-reactid="185"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="186"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="187"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/303a4f511e47d5a5d2698e4378bed266/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6b753456-63ee-447b-a5ba-4f0ac7491e2d.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:46.84343434343434% 33.55817875210793%;" data-reactid="188"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/303a4f511e47d5a5d2698e4378bed266/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6b753456-63ee-447b-a5ba-4f0ac7491e2d.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:46.84343434343434% 33.55817875210793%;" data-reactid="189"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b62f1907447e71325fa6e974789fb674/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6b753456-63ee-447b-a5ba-4f0ac7491e2d.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:46.84343434343434% 33.55817875210793%;" data-reactid="190"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a457919a409d2f0aac175d0a292580d3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6b753456-63ee-447b-a5ba-4f0ac7491e2d.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:46.84343434343434% 33.55817875210793%;" data-reactid="191"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="593" data-ratio="1.3355817875210794" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/303a4f511e47d5a5d2698e4378bed266/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6b753456-63ee-447b-a5ba-4f0ac7491e2d.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:46.84343434343434% 33.55817875210793%;" data-reactid="192"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="193"><!-- react-empty: 194 --><!-- react-empty: 195 --><!-- react-empty: 196 --><!-- react-empty: 197 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="198"><!-- react-text: 199 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="200"><p data-reactid="201">The Vincent "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" </p></div><a class=" " href="the-vincent-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-with-the-fir" data-reactid="202"><!-- react-empty: 203 --></a><!-- react-empty: 204 --><!-- react-empty: 205 --></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="206"><p>The Vincent "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" with the first postwar series B Rapide.

King won the 1958 350cc race at "the Triangle", a road course in Northern Ireland. The North West 200 was originally run over a distance of 200 miles on public roads in the North West of Ireland, it was moved to the north coast but the name was never changed. The course is still a street circuit, made up of public roads running between the towns of Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush (the Triangle) is one of the fastest in the world, with speeds in excess of 200 mph (320 km/h). Alistair King began racing in 1953, in the Club Mans Senior TT on a Norton. The Club Mans race class was intended for amateurs and was established in 1947 by the Auto-Cycle Union, Alistair came in fifth at his first TT race. By 1957 King was entered in the "professional" Senior TT and came in seventh. In 1958 on his Norton Manx he earned his first World Championship point placing sixth in the Senior TT. In 1959 Alistair King won the newly established 350 Formula One TT , which was open for production racers , but more important was his second in the Senior TT and third place in the Junior TT. He was also sixth in the 500cc class at the Ulster GP and he again won the 350cc North West 200. 1961 was his best year. In the Isle of Man TT he took fourth place in the Senior TT, and at Ulster he was second in the 350 cc class with Bianchi and third in the 500cc class with Norton. In the 500cc race in Monza he finished second. He thus finished fifth in the standings of the 500cc World Championship.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-09e8b97b-bc42-4dd2-b15a-d8884587be04" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="232"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="233"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d58bcffb-4483-4ac1-8068-b33af6dbab6b.jpg" alt="Jimmie Guthrie - Joe Craig"><p>Jimmie Guthrie with Joe Craig at the 1931 Isle of Man on the Norton CS1 500 that would dominate the TT for years. Guthrie's first TT win was in the 1930 lightweight race on an AJS at the age of 33. The first year he raced at the TT was 1927 when he was
    offered a New Hudson motorcycle factory ride. He did not disappoint by coming in second place behind two-time TT winner Alex Bennett. Jimmie also won the 1935 and 36 German 500cc Grand Prix. The victory at the 1936 German GP was made even more satisfying
    because the trophy was presented by Adolf Hitler who was expecting a German victory. Guthrie would die in a fatal crash at the German Grand Prix the following year in what some suggest was no accident. In 1992 rider Stanley Woods made this statement
    :<br>- Stanley Woods 1992<br>("I am ready to swear that Jimmie was fouled. I saw the accident, because I rolled out with a broken fuel pump. Two riders passed me, a German and Guthrie. This was just before the downhill right-hander, who went through
    Jimmie at full throttle . The German knew that Guthrie was right behind him, as he already followed him for some time. But the German could not take full curve, lifted, moved to Jimmies line and forced him off the track in a number of young trees.
    He ended up in a ditch embankment. ")<br>Suggesting that Kurt Mansfeld was to blame for the disaster. Guthrie had a two minute lead on Karl Gall with only a few hundred meters before the finish line when he struck Mansfeld who was a lap behind. It
    has long been speculated that a chain break or other mechanical malfunction caused the accident or maybe the Nazi's just couldn't bear another defeat, we'll never know.</p></div><div class="fl-l

He was one of the best riders of his era. The highlight of his career was winning the 1952 Australian Championship. Aussie Speedway racers build some crazy rigs and Hodgekiss's ride has to be one of the most famous builds. His twin J.A.P. engined sidecar rig was often called the ‘Hodgekiss Horrors’ by the racing press because of some spectacular crashes on the track. The two 500cc J.A.P. motors coupled in tandem are impressive even sitting idle. the Sydney Sports Ground Speedway was world famous as the venue for Australian Championships where all speedway divisions of both solo motorcycle, sidecar and speedcars (midget autos) were raced in contests between Australia and England. In an era when death was an accepted risk of the sport, 12 competitors lost their lives while racing at the Sydney Sports Ground. In the most tragic accident, close friends off the track Norm Clay and Ray Duggan both died after crashing together in a Solo race at the track on 21 January 1950.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-248ec9a1-d520-4c53-b7f9-1bfc102e79bc" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="307"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="308"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/045c4636-844b-4302-8d51-547afb380188.jpg" alt="Giuliano Maoggi"><p>Giuliano Maoggi on a Ducati Marianna 125cc at the Motogiro d'Italia races in 1956. This picture was taken when Maoggi won overall 1st place, a victory that played a large part in saving Ducati from possible closure. Giuseppe Montano the Director of Ducati,
    had recently hired Fabio Taglioni with the hope that he could design a motorcycle that would win the Motogiro. Italian resistance motorcycle races were extremely popular in Italy in the 1950s and Montano wanted the spotlight on Ducati. The most prestigious
    races at the time were the "Motogiro d'Italia" and the "Milano-Taranto", two road races that crossed the Italian peninsula and thus attracted the attention of people from across the country. A win in the "Motogiro d'Italia" meant fame for Maoggi (nicknamed
    "il duca italiano" the Italian duke), and boosted sales of Ducati motorcycles. By February of 1955, Taglioni had produced the first prototype of the 100cc Gran Sport, known as Marianna. After some testing at the high speed track in Modena the Marianna
    was officially presented to the public on March 5th, 1955. Thirty seven 100cc Gran Sport motorcycles competed in the Motogiro d'Italia on April 17th thru the 25th, in 1955. Out of the 200 riders that contacted Ducati to participate in the race, 25
    were chosen for the official Ducati factory works team (while independent riders rode the remaining 12 Mariannas).</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="309"><!-- react-empty: 310 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-5550ee73-d5af-4cb2-a9b8-5f3a397b4b52" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="311"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="312"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ee692fd0-c47b-46a0-85a7-617bc286ff7f.jpg" alt="Joe Petrali set the land speed record"><p>On March 13, 1937, Joe Petrali set the land speed record for two-wheeled vehicles on a 4-valve 61 OHV with a speed of 136.183 miles per hour on the beach at Daytona, Florida. He rode a blue 1936 EL equipped with a 61 cubic inch Knucklehead engine that
    was specially designed for the attempt. It featured low-slung handlebars, and a fairing made from a cut and reshaped gas tank, also a rear tail finassembly was fitted for aerodynamics. The tail fin had to be removed for the official attempt, though,
    because it produced excessive vibration. Petrali won his 49th and final AMA national on August 29, 1937 at the national hillclimb in Muskegon, Michigan. In 1937, the AMA introduced a new class called Class C which featured street-legal motorcycles
    in an effort to make motorcycle racing less expensive for ordinary motorcyclists. Petrali saw the change as rank amateurs taking to the track on heavy street bikes rather than a track full of seasoned pros like Class A racing. But manufacturers were
    cutting back on racing budgets during the Great Depression, spelling the end of Class A competition and, the Class C championship became the most important championship. Petrali’s final race was at the Oakland 200 in November of 1938. It was his one
    and only Class C race. It was on an oiled-down one mile dirt track. Bikes were sliding everywhere and Petrali was almost hit several times. Smok'n Joe pulled off the track and hung up his leathers for good. The last great Class A champion walked away
    from racing.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="313"><!-- react-empty: 314 --></div></section><section id="section-InfiniteScroll-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="315"><span style="font-size:0;" data-reactid="316"></span><div class="Component p-1 color-title color-text " data-reactid="317"><p data-reactid="318">loading ...</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="319"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="320"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="321"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="322"><span data-reactid="323"><!-- react-empty: 324 --><h2 data-reactid="325"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="326">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="327"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="328"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="329"><div class="Link" data-reactid="330"><a data-reactid="331"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="332"><a data-reactid="333"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

Phil Irving the engineer and author famous for his work with Vincent and Velocette, met Philip Vincent just prior to the 1931 British motorcycle show. Vincent offered Irving a job at his business in Stevenage alongside engineer E.J. Massey from the original HRD company. Irving also wrote atechnical column in Motor Cycling magazine under the pseudonym 'Slide Rule' around this time. Phil worked on drawing up the TT's nickel cast-iron cylinder with finned aluminum jacket and designing an aluminum cylinder head and new camshaft. With a blower added it was hoped that the TT would output 35 to 45hp, but in the end the supercharged machine was too heavy, too thirsty, ran way too hot and couldn't beat the latest Nortons. While testing the machines prior to the TT the decision was made to convert them back to normally aspirated machines and in reflection Irving noted that if the time spent on supercharging the Comet had been directed at the normally aspirated machines the outcome at the tT might have been more successful.

In 1931 Enzo Ferrari approached Vittorio Guerzoni at Mignon about developing an new racing motorcycle for the Ferrari race team.

Guthrie's first TT win was in the 1930 lightweight race on an AJS at the age of 33. The first year he raced at the TT was 1927 when he was offered a New Hudson motorcycle factory ride. He did not disappoint by coming in second place behind two-time TT winner Alex Bennett. Jimmie also won the 1935 and 36 German 500cc Grand Prix. The victory at the 1936 German GP was made even more satisfying because the trophy was presented by Adolf Hitler who was expecting a German victory. Guthrie would die in a fatal crash at the German Grand Prix the following year in what some suggest was no accident. In 1992 rider Stanley Woods made this statement : - Stanley Woods 1992 (\"I am ready to swear that Jimmie was fouled. I saw the accident, because I rolled out with a broken fuel pump. Two riders passed me, a German and Guthrie. This was just before the downhill right-hander, who went through Jimmie at full throttle . The German knew that Guthrie was right behind him, as he already followed him for some time.

of the legendary characters of Australian Speedway Sidecar racing, was Charles ‘Chook’ Hodgekiss. He was one of the best riders of his era. The highlight of his career was winning the 1952 Australian Championship. Aussie Speedway racers build some crazy rigs and Hodgekiss's ride has to be one of the most famous builds. His twin J.A.P. engined sidecar rig was often called the ‘Hodgekiss Horrors’ by the racing press because of some spectacular crashes on the track. The two 500cc J.A.P. motors coupled in tandem are impressive even sitting idle. the Sydney Sports Ground Speedway was world famous as the venue for Australian Championships where all speedway divisions of both solo motorcycle, sidecar and speedcars (midget autos) were raced in contests between Australia and England. In an era when death was an accepted risk of the sport, 12 competitors lost their lives while racing at the Sydney Sports Ground. In the most tragic accident, close friends off the track Norm Clay and Ray Duggan both died after crashing together in a Solo race at the track on 21 January 1950.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"e1a7a7c2-281a-4ac4-bfa4-7e971df1e3cb","item":"7b00c12e-9045-44d8-ab05-ced4f52e9123","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_caption":"Charles ‘Chook’ Hodgekiss - Two 500cc J.A.P.
