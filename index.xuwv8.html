Vincent's lead engineer Australian, Phil Irving was developing the Series B Rapide and wanted to see if the new machine had racing potential. So in 1947 Philip
    Vincent asked works test rider George Brown and his brother Cliff who also worked at Vincent to develop a race bike out of available Rapide spares. Cliff was the factory race mechanic and he started with a well used engine, massaging the internal
    components and adding a matched set of high lift cams and extra valve springs. He fitted larger carbs and George modified the frame using the engine as a stressed member and a cantilever design swing arm with two dampers similar to a modern Monoshock
    system (only 25 years earlier).</p><p>George Brown was already an established road racer winning many races on his 500cc Series A Comet Special, known as his "Cadwell Special" for his numerous wins at Cadwell Park. George began entering the 1000cc Rapide in several events setting a track
    record at Haddenham and winning everything from sprints to hillclimbs. Philip Vincent loaned the racer for a weeklong test ride to British motorcycle journalist Charles Markham for an article he was writing that would appear in the November 13, 1947,
    issue of Motor Cycling. It was this quote “You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din” from Rudyard Kipling's poem which Markham used in his article that gave the machine it's name while remarking that the Vincent exceeded the author's own capabilities.</p><p>In 1948, George Brown raced "Gunga Din" at the Isle of Man TT setting the fastest lap at 82.65 mph but George was robbed of victory when he ran out of fuel. Although, George showed amazing tenacity when he pushed his Vincent the final six miles to the
    finish line taking sixth place!</p><p>This photo of “Gunga Din” was taken in May of 1953 at Carrigrohane, Ireland and shows Philipe Vincent on the left with his wife Frida and racers Dennis O’Neill and Harry Lindsay. Lindsay set a new Irish speed record of 143 mph on “Gunga Din” that day.
    The improvements developed through racing experience formed the basis for the Black Shadow, and the Black Lightning the most notorious of all Vincent models.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="13"><!-- react-empty: 14 --></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-83139963-2a82-4cc7-af49-fa40f99efd54" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="17"><a class=" " href="renzo-pasolini-i-race-because-i-love-to-do-itif-i-win-e" data-reactid="18"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="19"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="20"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5f50a77893cefa42aced67881b8ed7fe/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a38edc-8f6e-4c0d-8e58-92c84c9152df.jpg&amp;width=638" style="object-position:52.82131661442007% 36.48989898989899%;" data-reactid="21"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5f50a77893cefa42aced67881b8ed7fe/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a38edc-8f6e-4c0d-8e58-92c84c9152df.jpg&amp;width=638" style="object-position:52.82131661442007% 36.48989898989899%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5f50a77893cefa42aced67881b8ed7fe/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a38edc-8f6e-4c0d-8e58-92c84c9152df.jpg&amp;width=638" style="object-position:52.82131661442007% 36.48989898989899%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/22a7a5ea0a96aba8ffadd6b8965e6b63/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a38edc-8f6e-4c0d-8e58-92c84c9152df.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:52.82131661442007% 36.48989898989899%;" data-reactid="24"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="638" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.8055555555555556" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5f50a77893cefa42aced67881b8ed7fe/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a38edc-8f6e-4c0d-8e58-92c84c9152df.jpg&amp;width=638" style="object-position:52.82131661442007% 36.48989898989899%;" data-reactid="25"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="32"><p>Renzo Pasolini "I race because I love to do it...if I win, even better!" Pasolini was born in Rimini, Italy, and was a works rider for Aermacchi, Benelli and Harley-Davidson. In 1962, he debuted with the Aermacchi 175cc, and his two first-place finishes were ahead of Giacomo Agostini! He took a two-year break from racing to complete his military service and returned in 1964, racing Aermacchi 250cc and 350cc bikes at the senior level. In the 1965 Italian championship, Pasolini, racing a Benelli, finished second in the 250cc class and third in the 350cc class. In 1966 in the final race of the Italian championship, Pasolini won on the then-new four-cylinder Benelli 500. This marked the start of his epic battles with Hailwood riding for Honda, and Agostini riding for MV Agusta.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="34"><a class=" " href="peugeot-factory-rider-paul-pean-in-this-photo-won-the-1926-g" data-reactid="35"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="36"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="37"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/66afc1e59f653b75611c39d8b1e91843/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faae73e2f-deb5-4635-95d0-8d3ae7e21500.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:55.55555555555556% 79.38247011952191%;" data-reactid="38"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/66afc1e59f653b75611c39d8b1e91843/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faae73e2f-deb5-4635-95d0-8d3ae7e21500.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:55.55555555555556% 79.38247011952191%;" data-reactid="39"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2edc9e251d559625625a496140a8ad4a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faae73e2f-deb5-4635-95d0-8d3ae7e21500.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:55.55555555555556% 79.38247011952191%;" data-reactid="40"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9d8705984bed5c41aafa614f308cb732/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faae73e2f-deb5-4635-95d0-8d3ae7e21500.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:55.55555555555556% 79.38247011952191%;" data-reactid="41"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="502" data-ratio="1.5776892430278884" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/66afc1e59f653b75611c39d8b1e91843/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faae73e2f-deb5-4635-95d0-8d3ae7e21500.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:55.55555555555556% 79.38247011952191%;" data-reactid="42"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --><!-- react-empty: 45 --><!-- react-empty: 46 --><!-- react-empty: 47 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="48"><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="50"><p data-reactid="51">Paul Pean - Peugeot</p></div><a class=" " href="peugeot-factory-rider-paul-pean-in-this-photo-won-the-1926-g" data-reactid="52"><!-- react-empty: 53 --></a><!-- react-empty: 54 --><!-- react-empty: 55 --></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="56"><p>Peugeot factory rider Paul Pean in this photo won the 1926 Grand Prix of Lyon on the SOHC 500 twin. Pean had previously won the 1920 GP of Lyon on the earlier version of the 500 twin Peugeot. The original Ernest Henry design was the first 4 valve per cylinder double overhead camshaft motorcycle engine. Pean set speed records in 1914 at Fontainebleau and made record attempts at Brooklands on the gear driven DOHC 8-valve version designed by Marcel Grémillon but even with a new 3-speed gearbox the design proved fragile yielding limited success prior to WWI.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Graphical-d7d95592-5818-43b7-a6f3-fc0700ae0003" class="Section Section--components-1

Designed shortly after the end of WWII in 1948 by Salvatore Majorca of Turin Italy this machine was a stunning aerodynamic masterpiece that unfortunately the world just wasn't quite ready for. The stylish body work conceals a 500cc Moto Guzzi v-twin power plant. The unique wheels also provided the suspension via a rubber disk bound to the rim and the hub supposedly providing a floating effect. It's hard to imagine this concept working, I can only imagine that initial testing was limited to a parking lot. None the less it's a very interesting prototype that must have grabbed a lot of attention in 1948!</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-0c423d9b-0519-44c2-8937-f6bdd4bafbe2" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="113"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="114"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7f44c7ae-da1f-49d6-98c2-a3d1ff497eaf.jpg" alt="Albert Sourdot"><p>Albert Sourdot won the lightweight French Grand Prix on a Monet-Goyon powered by a 175cc Villers 2-stroke engine an amazing 6 times. Albert won first in 1924, 25, 27, 28, 29, and again in 1930 (in 1926 Sourdot tied for first with Alexandre Hommaire who
    also rode a Monet-Goyon). Sourdot also won the 175cc Class in the Bol d'Or race, covering 290 laps (940 miles) in the Forest of Fontainbleau, at a speed of 42mph! At the Montlhéry Race Track in France, Monet Goyon took the World Standing Start and
    Flying Kilometre Class Records with Albert Sourdot riding, and the 175cc Class World Records for 500km at 51.2mph - 1,000km at 50.3mph - 1,500km at 50.75mph - 2,000km at 52.06mph. Monet-Goyon motorcycles were made in France from about 1917 to 1959.
    The factory was located in Mâcon, in the Saône-et-Loire region of Burgundy. The Mâcon factory also built Koehler Escoffier motorcycles and manufactured Villiers 2 stroke engines under license as well as motorcycles utilizing Swiss MAG brand 4 stroke
    engines up until 1939. After the end of World War II, Monet-Goyon resumed production of small displacement motorcycles and scooters until finally closing its doors at the end of the 1950’s.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="115"><!-- react-empty: 116 --></div></section><section id="section-v_Graphical-765bad93-5b25-4230-9acb-ba586b8528f9" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="117"><div class="Component p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="118"><div class="Group Group--graphical max-w-768px p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="119"><a class=" " href="765bad93-5b25-4230-9acb-ba586b8528f9" data-reactid="120"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="121"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="122"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0fa259a65663465e80f0d7331b1386b3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8504cf22-c2f9-4f3e-8141-1d69ae6c9c76.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:54.7979797979798% 37.267904509283824%;" data-reactid="123"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0fa259a65663465e80f0d7331b1386b3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8504cf22-c2f9-4f3e-8141-1d69ae6c9c76.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:54.7979797979798% 37.267904509283824%;" data-reactid="124"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f79ebe7055d1b796210e23b85c77ce35/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8504cf22-c2f9-4f3e-8141-1d69ae6c9c76.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:54.7979797979798% 37.267904509283824%;" data-reactid="125"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/580ce3caf93d863e2ca6466e869be8e9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8504cf22-c2f9-4f3e-8141-1d69ae6c9c76.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:54.7979797979798% 37.267904509283824%;" data-reactid="126"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="754" data-ratio="1.0503978779840848" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0fa259a65663465e80f0d7331b1386b3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8504cf22-c2f9-4f3e-8141-1d69ae6c9c76.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:54.7979797979798% 37.267904509283824%;" data-reactid="127"/></picture></div></a><!-- react-empty: 128 --><!-- react-empty: 129 --><!-- react-empty: 130 --></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-49f38a0c-d022-4c4c-9aa7-5119e07237cc" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="131"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="132"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b6ba0327-f894-46d9-948b-ccc93382846f.jpg" alt="Eagle Rock Hill Climb"><p>The Eagle Rock Hill Climb is the oldest recorded official hill climb ever run in the United States.

    years until safety concerns by public officials closed it down in 1906.</p><p>This rider has reached "the point of no return". An Aviation term, the point of no return is the point beyond which one must continue on one's current course of action because turning back is physically impossible. PNR (point of no return) is more often
    referred to by fighter pilots as the "Radius of Action formula" a technical term in air navigation that refers to the point on a flight at which, due to fuel consumption, a plane is no longer capable of returning to the airfield from which it took
    off. Actually this fellow has just past the center of gravity and no amount of torque is going to find his balance point again. That's going to leave a mark for sure. A reminder to Cycle Cultist's in the Mid West that the Devils Staircase 66th annual

Pasolini lost his life in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza on 20 May 1973. Renzo was not able to finish the 350cc race because of mechanical problems, withdrawing from competition with only four laps to go, and fell during the first lap of the 250cc race.

</picture><p>Gene Vincent was a Mod? I'm not sure Vincent Eugene Craddock knew where the battle lines were drawn in British youth culture. He grew up in Norfolk, Virginia a big US Navy port so it's no surprise that he dropped out of school at seventeen and enlisted.
    Working-class families in US and England suffered harsh economic realities in the wake of WWII. Nor is it surprising that Gene re-enlisted and spent his $612 dollar re-up bonus money on a new Triumph. In some ways we can credit Vincent's motorcycle
    crash which shattered his leg with starting his music journey, because Gene had planned on being a career Navy sailor. After being medically discharged by the Navy he became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene
    Vincent, and formed a rockabilly band called the Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy). The rock n roll scene aesthetics in the US at that point leaned heavily toward the Greaser look thanks to films like "The Wild
    One" 1953 and "Rebel Without a Cause" 1955. Vincent's huge hit "Be-Bop-A-Lula" came out in 1956 and drew comparisons to Elvis Presley. Between 1957 and 1959 Gene Vincent was on a roll. He toured Australia with Little Richard and Eddie Cochran in 1957
    also appearing with them in the film, The Girl Can't Help It with Jayne Mansfield. Vincent's last American hit single "Dance to the Bop" was used in the movie Hot Rod Gang and the group performed the song on the nationally-broadcast Ed Sullivan Show.</p><p>It was a dispute with the US tax authorities and the American Musicians' Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band's equipment to pay a tax bill that led him to leave the US and try his hand in Europe.</p><p>On December 15, 1959, Vincent appeared on Jack Good's TV show Boy Meets Girl, his first appearance in England. It would be this performance that would forever define Vincent as a "Rocker" in England. He wore black leather, gloves, and a medallion, and
    stood in a hunched posture thanks to that crash on his Triumph that left him with a steel sheath around the leg. After the TV appearance he toured France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK performing in his motorcycle leathers. Bob Dylan's "The
    Times They Are a-Changin" came out in 1964 and I'm not sure Vincent saw the coming change.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8mkeNlJhEeI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8mkeNlJhEeI&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8mkeNlJhEeI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=b7d04c9b404c499eba89ee7072e1c4f7&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube"

That big grin from the normally shy racer wearing a helmet with a caricature drawing of himself is just perfect. One of my favorite stories about Hailwood the man is from his automotive racing days. In 1973 at the South African Grand Prix, Hailwood and Clay Regazzoni crashed. Regazzoni's car caught fire and he was knocked unconscious. With disregard for his own safety, Hailwood tried to pull Clay from the burning car igniting his own clothing. Mike was waving his arms around frantically in an attempt to put out the flames when a corner marshal arrived with a fire extinguisher and put the flames on his clothes out. Regazzoni's car was still engulfed in flames, but Mike went right back in and pulled Clay to safety likely saving the drivers life.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-85408094-7a7d-452a-8876-6776d94c6268" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="198"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="199"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f34f0720-29d5-40b5-af4f-782c20c86157.jpg" alt="Oscar Hedstr&ouml;m"><p>Oscar Hedström built the first Indian prototype in 1901 and was co-founder of the Indian Motorcycle Company with George Hendee. Both Hedström and Hendee were bicycle racers before joining forces. George Hendee was the National Amateur High Wheel Champion
    in the US from 1882 thru 1886. After Hendee retired from professional racing he began selling bicycles and in 1897 he started his own manufacturing company in Springfield, Massachusetts. Oscar Hedström was a Swedish immigrant, a journeyman watchmaker
    and amateur bicycle racer. In his spare time Oscar built professional track bicycles. One of Hedström's cycle racing partners around 1896 was C.S. Henshaw who was touring the country racing bicycles with sponsorship provided by a tire manufacturer.
    In 1897 Henshaw met Kenneth Skinner who campaigned a De Dion engine powered tricycle and had just opened a dealership. Henshaw went to work for Skinner doing public motorcycle exhibitions at velodromes with renowned French racer, Henry Fournier. Over
    150 different motorcycle and automobile manufacturers licensed the De Dion engine and Skinner was the sole US importer. In 1899 C.S. Henshaw teamed up with Oscar Hedström to build De Dion powered motor-paced racing cycles for Stayer bicycle racing
    on the high banked velodromes. Pacers were designed to split the wind for the bicyclists (Stayer) who rode in their draft while attempting speed records. It was at a Stayer race at Madison Square Garden in 1900 that George Hendee first saw one of
    the Henshaw-Hedström motorized tandem pacers. Impressed with the performance, George met with Oscar and posed the idea of building a lightweight motorcycle for everyday transportation of their own design. The two men became partners and by early spring
    of 1901 the first prototype machine was ready for testing. The photo here is from 1910 and shows an Indian V-twin setup as a pacer. Indian produced their first v-twin factory racer in 1905 and their first production V-twin was sold to the public in
    1907. Oscar Hedström wasn't just content to design motorcycles, in 1903, he rode an Indian to a record 56 miles per hour on Ormond Beach in Florida. He continued attempting and coordinating record top-speed runs through the end of the decade. Oscar
    Hedström resigned from the Indian Motorcycle Company on March 24th 1913 after a disagreement with the board regarding dubious practices to inflate the company's stock values.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="200"><!-- react-empty: 201 --></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-23cd5cbf-dad1-4041-bbbe-70ee8ac47dae" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="202"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="203"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="204"><a class=" " href="the-prince-of-speed-phil-read-was-offered-an-mv-agusta-wor" data-reactid="205"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="206"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="207"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/21f203e3ceedfe0eccee81f9f6f40b29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd7e518cd-9412-4712-b272-cd513a66c0f5.jpg&amp;width=471" style="object-position:50.10615711252654% 50.063131313131315%;" data-reactid="208"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/21f203e3ceedfe0eccee81f9f6f40b29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd7e518cd-9412-4712-b272-cd513a66c0f5.jpg&amp;width=471" style="object-position:50.10615711252654% 50.063131313131315%;" data-reactid="209"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/21f203e3ceedfe0eccee81f9f6f40b29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd7e518cd-9412-4712-b272-cd513a66c0f5.jpg&amp;width=471" style="object-position:50.10615711252654% 50.063131313131315%;" data-reactid="210"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/402eb1d98080e83543b48904846619e9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd7e518cd-9412-4712-b272-cd513a66c0f5.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.10615711252654% 50.063131313131315%;" data-reactid="211"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="471" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.5946969696969697" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/21f203e3ceedfe0eccee81f9f6f40b29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd7e518cd-9412-4712-b272-cd513a66c0f5.jpg&amp;width=471" style="object-position:50.10615711252654% 50.063131313131315%;" data-reactid="212"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="213"><!-- react-empty: 214 --><!-- react-empty: 215 --><!-- react-empty: 216 --><!-- react-empty: 217 --><!-- react-empty: 218 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="219"><p>"The Prince of Speed" Phil Read was offered an MV Agusta works ride in 1972 along side Giacomo Agostini who was dominating the 500 GP. Ago had eight wins in a row in 1971 and in 1972, out of thirteen starts he scored an increadible eleven victories. But in 1973 Phil Read stole the spotlight taking the 500cc world championship. Read was a super competitive rider always focused on winning. In 1968 while riding for Yamaha he defied team orders, battling teammate Billy Ivy for the 250cc title and both riders finished the season tied on points. Read was awarded the championship but it soured his relationship with Yamaha which is how he ended up at MV. Agostini would make headlines in 1974 by leaving MV Agusta and signing with Yamaha. Read successfully defended his crown in 1974 with in what would be the last world championship for MV Agusta. Agostini and his Yamaha would come in second. It would also be the last time a four-stroke machine would win a title until the advent of the MotoGP class in 2002.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="220"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="221"><a class=" " href="the-nsu-rk-350-renn-kompressor-and-rk-500-had-two-cylind" data-reactid="222"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="223"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="224"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b1ecbc0e36a267d515a01dc1b019d243/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd759270c-14c1-4131-9527-6607cc3af947.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:89.01515151515152% 43.047337278106504%;" data-reactid="225"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b1ecbc0e36a267d515a01dc1b019d243/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd759270c-14c1-4131-9527-6607cc3af947.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:89.01515151515152% 43.047337278106504%;" data-reactid="226"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6fae4162871afc1ac4b6b3215ec57b45/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd759270c-14c1-4131-9527-6607cc3af947.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:89.01515151515152% 43.047337278106504%;" data-reactid="227"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/32dafdf5e79a6603f1cc7926efd5914f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd759270c-14c1-4131-9527-6607cc3af947.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:89.01515151515152% 43.047337278106504%;" data-reactid="228"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="676" data-ratio="1.1715976331360947" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b1ecbc0e36a267d515a01dc1b019d243/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd759270c-14c1-4131-9527-6607cc3af947.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:89.01515151515152% 43.047337278106504%;" data-reactid="229"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="230"><!-- react-empty: 231 --><!-- react-empty: 232 --><!-- react-empty: 233 --><!-- react-empty: 234 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="235"><!-- react-text: 236 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="237"><p data-reactid="238">NSU Renn Kompressor</p></div><a class=" " href="the-nsu-rk-350-renn-kompressor-and-rk-500-had-two-cylind" data-reactid="239"><!-- react-empty: 240 --></a><!-- react-empty: 241 --><!-- react-empty: 242 --></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="243"><p>The NSU RK 350 ("Renn Kompressor") and RK 500 had two cylinders and dual overhead camshafts . Each had its own camshaft bevel for the drive. Engine development was started in 1938, DKW was unbeatable in the 250 class with their ULD 250 a supercharged dual-piston two-stroke and even Moto Guzzi , Norton and Gilera were becoming stronger. Walter Moore ex-Norton engineer and Albert Roder who came to NSU in 1936 from Zundapp designed the engine with Moore as the chief engineer. NSU had high hopes for the 350cc compressor design especially after Heiner Fleischmann beat DKW's Ewald Kluge and Walfried Winkler but the machine was heavy and proved unreliable. In the 1939 Senior TT, Wilhelm Herz would pilot a 500cc machine and two 350cc compressor racers were deployed in the 350cc Junior. None of the NSU's reached the finish line. Wilhelm Herz fell in the second round. It was a unbearable debacle for Moore and the NSU team.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-InfiniteScroll-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="244"><span style="font-size:0;" data-reactid="245"></span><div class="Component p-1 color-title color-text " data-reactid="246"><p data-reactid="247">loading ...</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="248"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="249"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="250"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="251"><span data-reactid="252"><!-- react-empty: 253 --><h2 data-reactid="254"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="255">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="256"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="257"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="258"><div class="Link" data-reactid="259"><a data-reactid="260"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="261"><a data-reactid="262"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

I'm not sure Vincent Eugene Craddock knew where the battle lines were drawn in British youth culture. He grew up in Norfolk, Virginia a big US Navy port so it's no surprise that he dropped out of school at seventeen and enlisted. Working-class families in US and England suffered harsh economic realities in the wake of WWII. Nor is it surprising that Gene re-enlisted and spent his $612 dollar re-up bonus money on a new Triumph. In some ways we can credit Vincent's motorcycle crash which shattered his leg with starting his music journey, because Gene had planned on being a career Navy sailor. After being medically discharged by the Navy he became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent, and formed a rockabilly band called the Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy). The rock n roll scene aesthetics in the US at that point leaned heavily toward the Greaser look thanks to films like \"The Wild One\" 1953 and \"Rebel Without a Cause\" 1955. Vincent's huge hit \"Be-Bop-A-Lula\" came out in 1956 and drew comparisons to Elvis Presley. Between 1957 and 1959 Gene Vincent was on a roll. He toured Australia with Little Richard and Eddie Cochran in 1957 also appearing with them in the film, The Girl Can't Help It with Jayne Mansfield. Vincent's last American hit single \"Dance to the Bop\" was used in the movie Hot Rod Gang and the group performed the song on the nationally-broadcast Ed Sullivan Show.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"ba42089a-489d-439d-aa1e-6c292e7440c8","item":"ba5bf764-031f-4bb1-a255-b4b2320d2de8","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f0e02e6d8096a555e335b3503697c51c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9a546f803e495dab6d4ac5097e4c4a4/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=615"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f0e02e6d8096a555e335b3503697c51c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9c5166ff-ffbc-41c2-88e2-8ec25fa2ce4f.jpg&width=360"}],"resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/fc0c4af2b3079cbc7cdf8940ba61dd48.png","ratio":"205:264","aspect":0.7765151515151515,"orientation":"portrait","width":615,"height":792,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"faces":[{"x":181,"y":152,"width":67,"height":67,"confidence":5.022543},{"x":22,"y":111,"width":38,"height":38,"confidence":5.018635},{"x":0,"y":0,"width":60,"height":60,"confidence":5.004453},{"x":523,"y":565,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":5.00184},{"x":17,"y":331,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":5.001407},{"x":569,"y":657,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":4.999868}],"colors":[[209,196,179],[0,0,0],[158,143,124],[93,80,64],[56,46,36]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[55,85],[584,685]],"confidence":0.170636,"center":[368,369],"radius":324.889},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"eed6eaa8-1732-47fb-9ab3-0ace063b010e","item":"ba5bf764-031f-4bb1-a255-b4b2320d2de8","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Gene Vincent was a Mod?

That big grin from the normally shy racer wearing a helmet with a caricature drawing of himself is just perfect. One of my favorite stories about Hailwood the man is from his automotive racing days. In 1973 at the South African Grand Prix, Hailwood and Clay Regazzoni crashed. Regazzoni's car caught fire and he was knocked unconscious.

Both Hedström and Hendee were bicycle racers before joining forces. George Hendee was the National Amateur High Wheel Champion in the US from 1882 thru 1886. After Hendee retired from professional racing he began selling bicycles and in 1897 he started his own manufacturing company in Springfield, Massachusetts. Oscar Hedström was a Swedish immigrant, a journeyman watchmaker and amateur bicycle racer. In his spare time Oscar built professional track bicycles. One of Hedström's cycle racing partners around 1896 was C.S. Henshaw who was touring the country racing bicycles with sponsorship provided by a tire manufacturer. In 1897 Henshaw met Kenneth Skinner who campaigned a De Dion engine powered tricycle and had just opened a dealership. Henshaw went to work for Skinner doing public motorcycle exhibitions at velodromes with renowned French racer, Henry Fournier. Over 150 different motorcycle and automobile manufacturers licensed the De Dion engine and Skinner was the sole US importer. In 1899 C.S. Henshaw teamed up with Oscar Hedström to build De Dion powered motor-paced racing cycles for Stayer bicycle racing on the high banked velodromes. Pacers were designed to split the wind for the bicyclists (Stayer) who rode in their draft while attempting speed records. It was at a Stayer race at Madison Square Garden in 1900 that George Hendee first saw one of the Henshaw-Hedström motorized tandem pacers. Impressed with the performance, George met with Oscar and posed the idea of building a lightweight motorcycle for everyday transportation of their own design.
