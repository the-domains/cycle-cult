In the 1920s, the course was unpaved and drove from the frighteningly narrow pits on Rue de Laigné straight into the city, and took a tight hairpin right-hander near the river Sartre Pontlieue bridge, left the city again on the rather straight street now named Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder. Freddie's solo Douglas looks to be the 4 HP model with front and rear brakes. After WWI, Dixon went into business for himself at Park Garage on Linthorpe Road, Middlesbrough and competed in motorcycle races in various categories through out the 20's. He worked closely with Douglas in their Design and Racing Departments especially after his victory in the 1923 Isle of Man TT Motorcycle and Sidecar event. Freddie’s first solo TT win came in 1927 on a HRD machine. He retired from motorcycle racing in 1928 and left Douglas in 1930. After leaving Douglas, Freddie began to design and market a water-cooled 4 cylinder motorcycle but the Depression put an end to that venture. In 1932 Freddie began automotive racing with his own specially prepared Riley cars. He won the British Racing Driver Club 500 Mile Race at Brooklands in 1934 and 1936. he was the only man to lap Brooklands at 130mph in a car of less than 2 liters. In 1935 and 1936 he won the RAC TT car races held at the Ards circuit in Northern Ireland with his Riley. He is the only driver ever to have won TT races on two, three and four wheels, a record that still stands today. In 1938 Brough Superior based their 996 cc Four cylinder (doubly opposed) OHV, ‘Golden Dream’ on Freddie and 'Ike' Hatch's designs but production was stopped by the outbreak of WWII in 1939. In 1948 he was contacted by the Douglas motorcycle company to help in the development of their T35 motorcycle which was one of the first real new British post war designs, he redesigned the top half of the engine and these modifications resulted in the new Mark 3 Douglas machine. Dixon died on the 5th of November 1956 in Reigate, Surrey at age 64.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
