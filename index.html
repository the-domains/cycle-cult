Fred Osborne was a "Thirteen Black Cats" member, the first group of Hollywood stunt pilots. They were also called the Suicide
    Club. Not surprisingly, it didn't go well. Fred survived the fall after the parachute failedto open only because the telephone lines helped break his fall, he was carried off the beach in critical condition. This wasn't Fred's first brush with death,
    at Clover Field in Santa Monica on November 7, 1926, Bobby Chase, a female parachutist, got caught in her plane's landing gear when she jumped. Her pilot Kenneth Montee, unable to help, could only circle at 60 M.P.H. while Bobby floundered helplessly
    30 ft below the plane. Fred Osborne and Al Johnson, jumped into another plane and flew to her rescue. According to the Los Angeles Times, Osborne actually wing-walked on to Montee’s plane, and lowered himself down to the landing carriage where he
    managed to untangle the lines and cut the strap which was securing Chase. She deployed her parachute, landed on a street 2 miles away near Venice beach and sprained her ankle on a curb.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-b48485d9-a483-4f34-8713-0ade2bd1c042" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="17"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3eba0728-4890-478a-9fd9-e0adf4b0a6fb.jpg" alt="Jack Prince - Board Tracks"><p>By 1909, former champion bicycle racer Jack Prince had built the Los Angeles Coliseum Motordrome, a velodrome-like motorcycle racing facility that was just over 1⁄4 mile (0.40 km) in circumference. The first board track built specifically for motorsport
    racing in the US was the circular Los Angeles Motordrome built in 1910. It was a 1.0 mile (1.6 km) scaled-up version of a bicycling velodrome built by Jack Prince and mechanical engineer Frederick Moskovics in Playa del Rey near Los Angeles. That
    first track in Playa del Rey was banked at a 3:1 pitch (about 20 degrees), but later tracks were built with higher banking and some motorcycle tracks were banked up to 60 degrees. In 1919 Jack Prince built the 1.25 mi (2.01 km) Beverly Hills Speedway
    (also called the Los Angeles Speedway) wooden board track for motorcycle and automobile racing with Arthur Pillsbury. Prince and Pillsbury had set out to build the fastest race track in the nation. Pillsbury should be credited with the design as it
    was his studies of a method used by railroads, called the Searle Spiral Easement Curve, that was used to design the track's layout and contours. According to Pillsbury, a correctly engineered track could be driven without steering input from the driver,
    the car would steer itself, simply due to the track geometry. Board tracks were exceedingly dangerous due to flying wood splinters and debris, and due to sudden catastrophic tire failures caused by track conditions. The Los Angeles Speedway track
    was treated with a coating made from crushed sea shells to improve traction! A major contributor to the demise of board tracks was the high cost of maintenance, tracks needed new boards every five years on average. Carpenters would often repair the
    tracks from below, sometimes even during a race. The last championship race on timber was held at the infamous Altoona Speedway in 1931, motorcycle board track racing was completely dead by the 1940’s.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn3x-efce1e4f-6a53-451b-92c0-4e30b9f8f1c6" class="Section Section--components-3 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="22"><a class=" " href="on-february-22-1926-with-a-crowd-of-20000-the-fulfordmiam" data-reactid="23"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="24"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="25"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4c263dd4379785516ca0390bdc6bc12e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F05df07d7-a4f1-4e70-86a5-b9ba040536ab.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:50.063131313131315% 65.22435897435898%;" data-reactid="26"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4c263dd4379785516ca0390bdc6bc12e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F05df07d7-a4f1-4e70-86a5-b9ba040536ab.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:50.063131313131315% 65.22435897435898%;" data-reactid="27"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e7999fa379d0fb2655a69a05129e9439/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F05df07d7-a4f1-4e70-86a5-b9ba040536ab.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50.063131313131315% 65.22435897435898%;" data-reactid="28"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4e04281d1d75c6f98ffdb69dd9e1fff3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F05df07d7-a4f1-4e70-86a5-b9ba040536ab.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.063131313131315% 65.22435897435898%;" data-reactid="29"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="312" data-ratio="2.5384615384615383" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4c263dd4379785516ca0390bdc6bc12e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F05df07d7-a4f1-4e70-86a5-b9ba040536ab.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:50.063131313131315% 65.22435897435898%;" data-reactid="30"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="31"><!-- react-empty: 32 --><!-- react-empty: 33 --><!-- react-empty: 34 --><!-- react-empty: 35 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-text: 37 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="38"><p data-reactid="39">Fulford–Miami Speedway 1926</p></div><a class=" " href="on-february-22-1926-with-a-crowd-of-20000-the-fulfordmiam" data-reactid="40"><!-- react-empty: 41 --></a><!-- react-empty: 42 --><!-- react-empty: 43 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="44"><p>On February 22, 1926 with a crowd of 20,000 the Fulford–Miami Speedway held it's only race. The track's banking was at 50°, and as a result, cars had to drive at a speed of 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) in order to remain on the track without sliding off. Because of the speed the track's configuration produced, the track was considered to be the fastest in the world. The track was destroyed that same year in the costliest hurricane in U.S. history. The 1926 Miami hurricane damage would total $125 billion in todays dollars, triple that of Katrina. Its winds averaged 76.2 mph for 24 hours, the longest period on record for any area to experience hurricane-force winds. And never before had officials recorded an Atlantic hurricane with winds higher than 100 mph for more than an hour. the lumber that comprised the track's surface was scattered across the neighborhood, and was later, after being recovered, used by the city for reconstruction.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="46"><a class=" " href="on-july-4th-1939-noel-baddow-pope-was-timed-at-137-mph-over" data-reactid="47"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="48"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="49"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8a3bbb33f17bd3f055c13f7cf55a6bde/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe571440e-75fd-4ef8-856c-3667b2cef685.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.5% 14.124293785310735%;" data-reactid="50"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8a3bbb33f17bd3f055c13f7cf55a6bde/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe571440e-75fd-4ef8-856c-3667b2cef685.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.5% 14.124293785310735%;" data-reactid="51"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3ea5bef9d384b66d23c644e708c00af5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe571440e-75fd-4ef8-856c-3667b2cef685.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:37.5% 14.124293785310735%;" data-reactid="52"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0a8f297d458ae6ddb3f201bdabd4449a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe571440e-75fd-4ef8-856c-3667b2cef685.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:37.5% 14.124293785310735%;" data-reactid="53"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="708" data-ratio="1.11864406779661" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8a3bbb33f17bd3f055c13f7cf55a6bde/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe571440e-75fd-4ef8-856c-3667b2cef685.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:37.5% 14.124293785310735%;" data-reactid="54"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><!-- react-empty: 57 --><!-- react-empty: 58 --><!-- react-empty: 59 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="60"><!-- react-text: 61 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Noel Baddow Pope 1939</p></div><a class=" " href="on-july-4th-1939-noel-baddow-pope-was-timed-at-137-mph-over" data-reactid="64"><!-- react-empty: 65 --></a><!-- react-empty: 66 --><!-- react-empty: 67 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="68"><p>On July 4th 1939, Noel Baddow Pope was timed at 137 mph over a flying half-mile at the infamous Brooklands concrete bowl.

Check out this rendering of the 1937 TT Works Velocette race engine. The TT designation indicated the machine was intended for racing and it was in production from 1928 until 1950. Major changes to the design were designated as Mk1 thru Mk8 although not all marks were used. Despite being a design dating to 1928 it was good enough for Freddie Frith and Velocette to win the 350cc World Championship in 1949 on a works twin-cam engine. Based on the Velocette KSS, the KTT was developed as a production racer specifically for the Isle of Man TT course, which was the most important road race in the world at the time. A racing version of the Model K was built by Percy and Eugene Goodman, sons of the Velocette founder Johannes Gutgemann, in 1925 and after twelve months of development Velocette secured their first TT win in 1926. Alec Bennett was the winner with Gus Kuhn and Fred Povey finishing in the first nine to give the factory the team prize.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-c55993f1-06d5-41e3-8ccf-45d8efe8ad74" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="93"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="94"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="95"><a class=" " href="noel-pope-competed-at-the-isle-of-man-tt-sometimes-in-both-t" data-reactid="96"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="97"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="98"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ceade57a0b78a1fbcf3613cd03e4bab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb3483a8f-914a-45bc-bef8-388926a54473.jpg&amp;width=485" style="object-position:35.25773195876289% 13.688212927756654%;" data-reactid="99"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ceade57a0b78a1fbcf3613cd03e4bab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb3483a8f-914a-45bc-bef8-388926a54473.jpg&amp;width=485" style="object-position:35.25773195876289% 13.688212927756654%;" data-reactid="100"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ceade57a0b78a1fbcf3613cd03e4bab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb3483a8f-914a-45bc-bef8-388926a54473.jpg&amp;width=485" style="object-position:35.25773195876289% 13.688212927756654%;" data-reactid="101"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4c5974014ed399387c948ad48405820d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb3483a8f-914a-45bc-bef8-388926a54473.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:35.25773195876289% 13.688212927756654%;" data-reactid="102"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="485" data-height="789" data-ratio="0.614702154626109" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ceade57a0b78a1fbcf3613cd03e4bab/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb3483a8f-914a-45bc-bef8-388926a54473.jpg&amp;width=485" style="object-position:35.25773195876289% 13.688212927756654%;" data-reactid="103"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="104"><!-- react-empty: 105 --><!-- react-empty: 106 --><!-- react-empty: 107 --><!-- react-empty: 108 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="109"><!-- react-text: 110 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="111"><p data-reactid="112">Noel Pope - Velocette MK6 KTT</p></div><a class=" " href="noel-pope-competed-at-the-isle-of-man-tt-sometimes-in-both-t" data-reactid="113"><!-- react-empty: 114 --></a><!-- react-empty: 115 --><!-- react-empty: 116 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="117"><p>Noel Pope competed at the Isle of Man TT sometimes in both the Junior and Senior races from 1933 to 1939 and after the war in 1947 and 48.

At the time Ernest Henne held the record at 174 mph on a supercharged BMW set in 1937. Pope's streamlined Brough nicknamed "Silver Fish" because of it's polished aluminum body shell was expected to reach a top speed of over 200 mph. On a test run without the shell Noel reached 140 mph but on his first timed run with the streamlining he crashed at a speed of 150 mph.

This was about reclaiming the record for England from the Germans now that war time restrictions were relaxed. 'The Motor Cycle' magazine
    offered a trophy and £500 to the first British rider on an all-British motorcycle to gain the official motorcycle speed record. The J.A.P engined Brough Superior could produce 120 bhp with a blower where as Ernest Henne's BMW only made 78 bhp. Blackburn
    and General Aircraft would design the streamlined aluminum shell for the machine and including Noel Pope the machine only weighted 650 pounds. George Brough himself would accompany Noel Pope to Bonneville. The bike, body shell and spares were packed
    into crates and shipped to New York to be forwarded to Utah by rail. A screw-up at US Customs delayed the crates for 10 days and when they finally arrived the body work was damaged and last minute repairs were attempted to straighten out the body
    panels as best they could. Surprising few photographs of the event exist considering the potential importance if the record were to be broken. This photo was taken by none other than Rollie Free who in September of 1948 had set the US national motorcycle
    speed record of 150.313 mph (241.905 km/h) on an un-faired Vincent HRD motorcycle. Sadly Noel Pope and the "Silver Fish" as it would be come known would only reach 150 mph on the salt before crashing. Miraculously Pope walked away from the wreckage
    without serious injury.<br>photo ref: Rollie Free photo from "Flat Out!

Blackburn and General Aircraft of Brough, East Yorkshire, built the body which incorporated a large tail fin and was based on well established aircraft design. A third scale model was even constructed for testing in the company's wind tunnel. With a frontal area of 8.4 square feet, the drag coefficient was determined to be 0.00026 and at Bonneville's altitude it was estimated that it could reach a speed of 213 mph. Noel Pope was traveling at 150 mph in second gear when the machine started to veer to the right towards the 4 inch deep salt at the side of the track. Noel shifted his weight to the left in hopes of countering the drift, without effect so he then attempted to apply some steering input using the handlebars but the machine went into a high speed lock-to-lock wobble and crashed. Noel was luckily thrown clear of the carnage and escaped serious injury, tumbling along the salt ahead of the bike before ending underneath it.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-79f0f1ca-b1b3-44be-8020-907e549ee71b" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="189"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="190"><picture>

</picture><p>Berliner Motor Corporation in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey was the US distributor for Ducati from the 1950's through the 1980's and this image of the 350cc Desmo is the front of a 1969 sales flyer. Joseph Berliner founded his motorcycle business in New
    York City distributing and repairing Zündapp motorcycles east of the Mississippi in 1951, using contacts with that German manufacturer he had developed before World War II. He was a Hungarian Jewish refugee from the Holocaust who had spent time in
    Hungarian slave labor camps, and had lost 16 close family members on arrival at Auschwitz. Michael Berliner, the youngest of 5 brothers, was saved only because Joseph, and another Berliner brother, both of whom the SS intended to exploit for their
    skill as mechanics, convinced them that young Michael, too, was a mechanic. The Berliner brothers survived by maintaining a fleet of German army trucks. One brother would die of hunger and typhus, leaving only Joseph, Michael, and two other siblings
    alive after the war. Joseph emigrated to the US in 1947 and in 1957 he took over control of the International Motorcycle Company and their US distributorship of Zündapp, where he had previously been a partner. By 1965 Berliner was the US distributor
    for Matchless, Moto Guzzi, Norton, Sachs, Zündapp, and Ducati as well as selling Metzeler tires.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="191"><!-- react-empty: 192 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-d773c630-a42c-4b79-9ba6-9276c2d0a7db" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="193"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="194"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="195"><a class=" " href="the-ducati-berliner-1260-apollo-v4-delivered-a-claimed-100-h" data-reactid="196"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="197"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="198"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c7a0c5b558749d64f295f05973ac2219/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8c172fa-91cc-4dde-83fd-4568c6052259.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:86.74242424242425% 80.04484304932735%;" data-reactid="199"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c7a0c5b558749d64f295f05973ac2219/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8c172fa-91cc-4dde-83fd-4568c6052259.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:86.74242424242425% 80.04484304932735%;" data-reactid="200"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/523aeb248e1ea4e3a0d9553237404bc1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8c172fa-91cc-4dde-83fd-4568c6052259.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:86.74242424242425% 80.04484304932735%;" data-reactid="201"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fa3e42450401ceadfbd387a7baf8f204/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8c172fa-91cc-4dde-83fd-4568c6052259.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:86.74242424242425% 80.04484304932735%;" data-reactid="202"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="446" data-ratio="1.7757847533632287" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c7a0c5b558749d64f295f05973ac2219/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8c172fa-91cc-4dde-83fd-4568c6052259.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:86.74242424242425% 80.04484304932735%;" data-reactid="203"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="204"><!-- react-empty: 205 --><!-- react-empty: 206 --><!-- react-empty: 207 --><!-- react-empty: 208 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="209"><!-- react-text: 210 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="211"><p data-reactid="212">The Ducati Berliner 1260 Apollo V4</p></div><a class=" " href="the-ducati-berliner-1260-apollo-v4-delivered-a-claimed-100-h" data-reactid="213"><!-- react-empty: 214 --></a><!-- react-empty: 215 --><!-- react-empty: 216 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="217"><p>The Ducati Berliner 1260 Apollo V4 delivered a claimed 100 horsepower at 7000 rpm and was good for a top speed in excess of 120 mph. In fact it had too much power. When Ducati test rider Giancarlo Librenti took it out on the autostrada the specially made 16-inch rear tire (U.S. police regulations, required 16-inch tires) came apart at high speed and locked up the rear wheel. To cure the problem atwin-carb version of the engine was detuned bringing the horsepower down to 65, still superior to the Harley Davidson police bikes of the day that it was intended to compete with. It was also lighter than the Harleys, weighing 596 pounds dry vs. the V-twin's 640 pound weight. Ducati reluctantly canceled the project early in 1965 with a retail price estimated to be $1500 dollars it would have been double the cost of the equivalent Harley.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GhostedColumn-6fa2b21d-2bba-4143-8a2c-0ab72b379507" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-medium color-bg color-title

The Apollo ranks among the most ambitious (albeit unsuccessful) projects developed by the Borgo Panigale marque during the first half of the Sixties.Giuseppe Montano was Ducati CEO from 1952 to 1968 and was responsible for hiring Fabio Taglioni. Montano believed in mechanical innovation and was impressed by Taglioni's 1948 his mechanical-engineering degree project a 250cc, 90-degree V-four, his first-ever complete engine design. Montano gave Fabio the time, space, and resources to transform his ideas into real motorcycles. In fact Taglioni's first ohc, 750cc V-twin, was inspired by the Apollo's design.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-9f098e89-1fe8-45ec-ba36-911ea79c1f4c" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="252"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="253"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/483dd335-21f8-4694-aa04-65fcd85d4a5a.jpg" alt="Ducati Apollo Prototype 1,257cc V4"><p>Joseph Berliner the US distributor for Ducati was so influential in the lucrative American motorcycle market that in 1959 he approached Ducati about creating a rival to the Harley-Davidson to sell to police departments around the US. Berliner agreed to
    underwrite a portion of the development costs in 1961 and in 1964 Ducati delivered to Berliner a prototype of the "1260 Apollo", a 1,257 cc (76.7 cu in) V4 engine motorcycle producing 100 bhp (75 kW) and capable of over 120 mph (190 km/h). Fabio Taglioni
    had been asked to develop a bike that conformed to US police specifications, and was bigger than any current model Harley-Davidson. Taglioni decided on an air-cooled 1257 cc 90° two-valve head V4 using a 180-degree crankshaft with roller bearing big
    ends. That crankshaft fitted into a horizontally split wet sump crankcase with a center main bearing support. The bore was 84.5 mm, and the stroke 56 mm. Valve actuation was by pushrods and rocker arms. Ducati produced two prototypes (one of which
    was delivered to Berliner) and two extra engines as spares but the Apollo was sadly never put into production. The prototype was sold by Mike Berliner to Bob Schanz of Cincinnati-based DomiRacer who had purchased the contents of the Berliner warehouse
    when the company closed in '84. Bob sold it to collector Hiroaki Iwashita for $17,000.00 a princely sum in 1987. In 2000 the Ducati Museum in Bologna acquired the prototype and restored it in 2001.<br>ref:<a href="http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/apollo">http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/apollo</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="254"><!-- react-empty: 255 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-414b5dd9-a0ee-4e2f-b988-0f4dd5179589" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="256"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="257"><picture>

</picture><p>Evel Knievel is best remembered as riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles particularly the XR-750, but for his first known jump (over a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions) he used a 250cc Honda. For his next jump on January 23, 1966 he got Bob Blair,
    the West coast distributor for Berliner Motors to provide him with a Norton Atlas of all things. He only used the Norton for one year and thenswitched to using a Triumph Bonneville T120. Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New
    Year's Eve 1967. Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports but they declined. Knievel used his own money to have John Derek film the Caesars’ jump. To reduce costs, Derek used his then-wife Linda Evans as one of the camera
    operators. It was Linda who filmed Knievel’s famous crash landing. In 1968 Evel detailed plans for jumping the Grand Canyon using the "SkyCycle" a nitro-powered Triumph Bonneville with wings and twin jet engines pictured here. Thankfully that stunt
    never happened. By the way, Triumph notified Knievel that they would void the warranty on his Bonneville due to the addition of twin jet-engines. Then in another odd turn Evel secured sponsorship from Jack McCormack the US importer for Laverda. Knievel
    used the Laverda American Eagle 750cc motorcycle between December 1969 and April 1970. McCormack had been one of the people responsible for Honda’s hugely successful “You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda” ad campaign of the early 1960s.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="258"><!-- react-empty: 259 --></div></section><section id="section-LoadMoreWButton-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="260"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="261"><button class="color-box-pop pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="262"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-2rem h-2rem" data-reactid="263"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" enable-background="new 384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" xml:space="preserve"><path class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" d="M397.8,298c-7.4,0-13.4-6-13.4-13.4s6-13.4,13.4-13.4c5.3,0,10.2,3.2,12.3,8l-2.8,1.2  c-1.7-3.8-5.4-6.2-9.5-6.2c-5.7,0-10.4,4.7-10.4,10.4s4.7,10.4,10.4,10.4c4.6,0,8.7-3.1,10-7.5l2.9,0.8 C409.1,294,403.8,298,397.8,298z"/><polyline class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" points="410.9,274.4 410.9,281.2 404.1,281.2 "/><rect class="color-box-pop-text" x="396.6" y="280" fill="#F05525" width="2" height="9.2"/><rect x="393" y="283.6" class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" width="9.2" height="2"/></svg></span></button></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="264"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="265"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="266"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="267"><span data-reactid="268"><!-- react-empty: 269 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="270"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="271">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="272"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="273"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="274"><div class="Link" data-reactid="275"><a data-reactid="276"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

The track's banking was at 50°, and as a result, cars had to drive at a speed of 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) in order to remain on the track without sliding off. Because of the speed the track's configuration produced, the track was considered to be the fastest in the world. The track was destroyed that same year in the costliest hurricane in U.S. history.

This was about reclaiming the record for England from the Germans now that war time restrictions were relaxed. 'The Motor Cycle' magazine offered a trophy and £500 to the first British rider on an all-British motorcycle to gain the official motorcycle speed record. The J.A.P engined Brough Superior could produce 120 bhp with a blower where as Ernest Henne's BMW only made 78 bhp. Blackburn and General Aircraft would design the streamlined aluminum shell for the machine and including Noel Pope the machine only weighted 650 pounds. George Brough himself would accompany Noel Pope to Bonneville. The bike, body shell and spares were packed into crates and shipped to New York to be forwarded to Utah by rail. A screw-up at US Customs delayed the crates for 10 days and when they finally arrived the body work was damaged and last minute repairs were attempted to straighten out the body panels as best they could. Surprising few photographs of the event exist considering the potential importance if the record were to be broken. This photo was taken by none other than Rollie Free who in September of 1948 had set the US national motorcycle speed record of 150.313 mph (241.905 km/h) on an un-faired Vincent HRD motorcycle.

He was a Hungarian Jewish refugee from the Holocaust who had spent time in Hungarian slave labor camps, and had lost 16 close family members on arrival at Auschwitz. Michael Berliner, the youngest of 5 brothers, was saved only because Joseph, and another Berliner brother, both of whom the SS intended to exploit for their skill as mechanics, convinced them that young Michael, too, was a mechanic. The Berliner brothers survived by maintaining a fleet of German army trucks. One brother would die of hunger and typhus, leaving only Joseph, Michael, and two other siblings alive after the war. Joseph emigrated to the US in 1947 and in 1957 he took over control of the International Motorcycle Company and their US distributorship of Zündapp, where he had previously been a partner. By 1965 Berliner was the US distributor for Matchless, Moto Guzzi, Norton, Sachs, Zündapp, and Ducati as well as selling Metzeler tires.</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"d773c630-a42c-4b79-9ba6-9276c2d0a7db":{"id":"d773c630-a42c-4b79-9ba6-9276c2d0a7db","index":12,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-24T22:59:43.654Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T23:00:38.542Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-24-the-ducati-berliner-1260-apollo-v4-delivered-a-claimed-100-h.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"the-ducati-berliner-1260-apollo-v4-delivered-a-claimed-100-h/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"The Ducati Berliner 1260 Apollo V4 delivered a claimed 100 horsepower at 7000 rpm and was good for a top speed in excess of 120 mph.

Fabio Taglioni had been asked to develop a bike that conformed to US police specifications, and was bigger than any current model Harley-Davidson. Taglioni decided on an air-cooled 1257 cc 90° two-valve head V4 using a 180-degree crankshaft with roller bearing big ends. That crankshaft fitted into a horizontally split wet sump crankcase with a center main bearing support. The bore was 84.5 mm, and the stroke 56 mm. Valve actuation was by pushrods and rocker arms. Ducati produced two prototypes (one of which was delivered to Berliner) and two extra engines as spares but the Apollo was sadly never put into production. The prototype was sold by Mike Berliner to Bob Schanz of Cincinnati-based DomiRacer who had purchased the contents of the Berliner warehouse when the company closed in '84. Bob sold it to collector Hiroaki Iwashita for $17,000.00 a princely sum in 1987. In 2000 the Ducati Museum in Bologna acquired the prototype and restored it in 2001.<br>ref:<a href=\"http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/apollo\">http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/apollo</a></p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"414b5dd9-a0ee-4e2f-b988-0f4dd5179589":{"id":"414b5dd9-a0ee-4e2f-b988-0f4dd5179589","index":15,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-24T22:54:52.587Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T22:55:51.490Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-24-evel-knievel-is-best-remembered-as-riding-harley-davidson-mo.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"evel-knievel-is-best-remembered-as-riding-harley-davidson-mo/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"Evel Knievel is best remembered as riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles particularly the XR-750, but for his first known jump (over a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions) he used a 250cc Honda. For his next jump on January 23, 1966 he got Bob Blair, the West coast distributor for Berliner Motors to provide him with a Norton Atlas of all things. He only used the Norton for one year and thenswitched to using a Triumph Bonneville T120. Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New Year's Eve 1967. Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports but they declined. Knievel used his own money to have John Derek film the Caesars’ jump. To reduce costs, Derek used his then-wife Linda Evans as one of the camera operators. It was Linda who filmed Knievel’s famous crash landing. In 1968 Evel detailed plans for jumping the Grand Canyon using the \"SkyCycle\" a nitro-powered Triumph Bonneville with wings and twin jet engines pictured here. Thankfully that stunt never happened. By the way, Triumph notified Knievel that they would void the warranty on his Bonneville due to the addition of twin jet-engines. Then in another odd turn Evel secured sponsorship from Jack McCormack the US importer for Laverda. Knievel used the Laverda American Eagle 750cc motorcycle between December 1969 and April 1970.
