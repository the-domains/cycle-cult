The engineer responsible for this remarkable achievement was Ernest Henry and he was just 27 years old at the time he joined Peugeot in 1911. Henry had previously studied at the Applied Mechanics Technical in Geneva later working on marine and aviation engines for Picker of Geneva and Motos Labor Manufacturing in Paris. Peugeot was already a major player in auto racing with drivers Georges Billet, Paul Zuccarelli, and Jules Goux driving for the factory team. These men convinced Robert Peugeot that an engine with optimized engine airflow utilizing twin cams and more valves could create impressive power. Peugeot embraced their theories and tasked young Ernest Henry with developing the new engine with input from the drivers. The old guard technical staff at Peugeot considered the project a foolish pursuit and began to call the team "Les Charlatans". Henry started from a blank page in the racing department, working in secret with a budget allocated by the factory. In early 1912 the design was completed and featured four inclined valves for each of the four cylinders with a twin camshaft cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers. The 4 valves per cylinder were arranged in V, with 7.6 liter (L76 type) and 3 liter (3 type) restricted capacity engines being built. The new lighter car could reach 120mph and won the 1912 French Grand Prix in both the unlimited and the three-liter restricted Coupe de l'Auto competition. In 1914 Henry designed a 500cc parallel-twin engine for the Peugeot 500 M racing motorcycle, using two 250cc cylinders from his auto engine design. It had a double overhead cam head, actuated by a cascade of gears and 4 valves per cylinder. The engine was very sophisticated for the time, however the head suffered from over heating issues attributed to the limited performance of metallurgy of the era, causing the cylinder heads to warp from excessive heat between the valve sockets. In 1919 Marcel Grémillon did a major re-design of the engine. Henry's original design had exposed valve train gear drive mechanism between the two cylinders, later versions like the one shown moved the drive to the side of the cylinders. After WWI in 1923, Lessman Antonesco revised the design with a single camshaft and two valves per cylinder, dry clutch, kick start, three-speed transmission and front brakes, it produced a claimed 27 hp.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
