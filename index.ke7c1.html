The 2 mile wooden oval track was located north of Cincinnati between Crescentville and Mosteller roads in Sharonville. The track
    opened September 4, 1916 and was a copy of the Chicago Speedway Park with a wooden surface 60 feet wide on the homestretch, 70 feet wide in the turns and 50 feet wide on the backstretch. The turns were banked at 19 degrees and reached 33 degrees at
    the very top. By 1917 the world was at war and the big three motorcycle involved in racing (Harley Davidson, Indian and Excelsior) had signed an agreement to suspend support for racing until the end of WWI. Factory support was still available for
    endurance runs and sanctioned speed challenges. Just four weeks prior Red Pankhurst riding for Harley Davidson had set new records and Cannonball Baker and Indian were determined to retake the 24 hour record. WWI was in full swing and the First Ohio
    Regiment under Colonel Galbraith, some 1,500 soldier were encamped at the track and I'm sure eager to watch the attempt. Baker would go after the 12 and 24 hour solo records and Teddy Carroll and George Von Staden would attack the sidecar records
    both would also set 500 and 1000 mile records. Both machines were on the track at the same time and three stops were made during the first 500 miles. The track was especially dangerous at night with very little lighting and close to midnight it started
    raining making the wood surface extremely slippery. The rain forced Baker to ride without googles and a bug struck him in the left eye. Not being able to see well Baker mis-judged a turn and slammed into the guard rail sending him and his machine
    sliding across the track for two hundred feet at 60 miles an hour. Luckily the bike suffered only a broken footboard and Baker was walked over to the First Regiments field hospital where his eye was attended to and he suffered only a bruised shoulder
    and some abrasions. Teddy and George pulled off the track as well and both machines were equipped with new lights. They were back on the track and back at it in 23 and a half minutes. By 2 o'clock the rain finally stopped and the men really started
    to pick-up speed again. The 1000 mile mark was reached at 16:14:15 on the solo and at 18:48:30 for the sidecar. It was a big boost for the Hendee factory and Indian touted the records in their advertising with pride. The last racing event held at
    the Cincinnati Speedway was a 48 hour endurance race for Essex Automobiles held in December of 1919. The Speedway was abandoned and dismantled with the lumber shipped to Chillicothe, Ohio to be used in the construction of Camp Sherman, one of the
    new training camps for the War effort. The camp was built on top of Hopewell Native American mounds in the area which were bulldozed to make way for the 1,370 buildings constructed at Camp Sherman. The camp also housed German prisoners of war, POWs
    remained at Camp Sherman until September 1919, several months after the war had ended.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-ca3612ba-9068-4dd9-ac71-d1114b731bbc" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="17"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="18"><a class=" " href="between-1969-and-1977-angel-nieto-won-six-of-the-nine-50cc-t" data-reactid="19"><div class="Cover ov-h " data-reactid="20"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="21"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d2f3a3c11b9079b682547da20ba4999/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51aea287-6e06-41c6-9e47-80af1a1886a0.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:51.010101010101% 31.372549019607842%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d2f3a3c11b9079b682547da20ba4999/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51aea287-6e06-41c6-9e47-80af1a1886a0.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:51.010101010101% 31.372549019607842%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/05b6e6ef8ed91802e974fc38805c6941/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51aea287-6e06-41c6-9e47-80af1a1886a0.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:51.010101010101% 31.372549019607842%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4ed050f92b82ab757078e0e6100ae7e0/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51aea287-6e06-41c6-9e47-80af1a1886a0.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:51.010101010101% 31.372549019607842%;" data-reactid="25"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="612" data-ratio="1.2941176470588236" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d2f3a3c11b9079b682547da20ba4999/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51aea287-6e06-41c6-9e47-80af1a1886a0.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:51.010101010101% 31.372549019607842%;" data-reactid="26"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="32"><!-- react-text: 33 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m " data-reactid="34"><p data-reactid="35">1977 Ángel Nieto</p></div><a class=" " href="between-1969-and-1977-angel-nieto-won-six-of-the-nine-50cc-t" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --></a><!-- react-empty: 38 --><!-- react-empty: 39 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="40"><p>Between 1969 and 1977 Ángel Nieto won six of the nine 50cc titles, losing only two titles.

The 50cc GP heats up with Kreidler also supporting racers Barry Sheene and Jarno Saarinen and Derbi adding Gilberto Parlotti for 1971. At the end of the season in the 50cc GP it was Jan DeVries in first and Nieto in second place but Nieto wins the 125cc championship. Ángel Nieto also competed in the 250cc GP as shown in this photo on a Derbi twin cylinder two-stroke.

The Soviet Union had entered a new era often
    called the "Era of Stagnation" under the rule of Leonid Brezhnev. The leadership set out to stabilize the Soviet economy and speed up growth with economic reforms. Needless to say motorcycle racing was probably low on the list of projects to undertake.
    But regardless the Central Construction and Experimental Department in Serpuchov (outside Moscow) was able to build a totally new GP racer designed by Russian engineer Evgenij Mathiushin. The motorcycle was inspired by several western machines most
    notably MV Agusta's dohc racers and the frame was similar to the Norton feather bed but the bike was all Russian. The 1964 Vostok S-364 sported a short stroke (49x46mm) engine with double overhead camshafts and 6-speed gearbox. USSR riders Nickolai
    Sevastyanov and Endel Kiisa competed in international grand prix events with the machine and did surprisingly well. In 1965, Endel Kiisa surprised the racing world at the GP of Finland by taking third place, behind Jim Redman and Bruce Beale on Hondas.
    But the Vostok racers were often forced to retire early with mechanical problems often destroying pistons in the final lap. The government was never fully behind the team and even though there was modest success, funding was pulled on the project.
    In 1968 some new life was breathed into the Vostok GP effort and a new "S-565" was debuted to compete in senior events. The 494 cc machine had a strengthened frame and a new head with three valves for each cylinder and was said to put out 80hp. At
    the 1968 GP in Finland, Nickolai Sevastyanov managed to finish in fourth place behind Agostini, Findlay and Marsowszki. 1969 was the last year for the Vostok racers and they only competed in one race in East Germany taking tenth place.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="68"><!-- react-empty: 69 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-d4b3ed16-c654-4d14-875c-95434cef9f19" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="70"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="71"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f09fdd11-effa-4ac3-b91b-e79eb6abf39a.jpg" alt="Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Carroll"><p>Edward "Teddy" Carroll was just 17 when he landed his dream job in 1914 as a test rider for Indian Motorcycles at the Hendee factory in Springfield, Massachusetts. In April of 1915, the factory furnished Teddy with an 8-valve racer for the Readville,
    Massachusetts races and he won his first professional race beating the H-D "wrecking crew's" Al Stratton and Irving Janke, and setting a new track record. Always a top contender Carroll came in 2nd at the 300-mile Chicago board track event and also
    came in 2nd at the 100-mile race in Milwaukee that same year. Teddy made headlines on August 16th 1917 at the Cincinnati Motor Speedway by setting the World's 12-hour, 24-hour, 500-mile and 1000-mile records for a motorcycle with a sidecar. With George
    Von Straden of Indianapolis in the chair, the standard Indian sidecar was used with the only alterations being that the springs were removed and the body dropped lower in the chassis. Von Stridden lay low as possible and worked a hand pump to keep
    gas feeding into the main fuel tank. The Indian captured the 500-mile record in less than 10 hours with an average speed of 56.1 miles an hour besting "Red" Parkhurst's record by 51 minutes. At the 12 hour mark they had covered 661 and a half miles
    breaking the old record by 47 and a half miles even after stopping to replace a fuel line and change a tire. Enduring several hours of rain the boys broke Parkhurst's 1000-mile record with a time of 18:48:30 shaving an hour and a half of the record.
    The Indian Power Plus hit the 24 hour mark with 1,275 miles under their belt. In 1919 it looked like Teddy might win the Marion, Indiana "Cornfield Classic" when he over took Otto Walker in the final laps. But Carroll was forced to stop and replace
    a broken exhaust valve spring which he accomplished in 2 minutes and 38 seconds on the 39th lap, but he would have to settle for 4th place behind the Harley riders Red Parkhurst 1st, Ralph Hepburn 2nd, and Otto Walker in 3rd.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="72"><!-- react-empty: 73 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-52a62404-d592-413a-bcb8-b709cc0e4d9b" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="74"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="75"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c63bb276-5713-481d-8782-ed1f66073ae9.jpg" alt="Howard Earle at Brooklands"><p>The Brooklands concrete banked oval was famous for speed record attempts in the 1930's. In this photo taken on Friday October 27th in 1938 the 3 hour 350cc record was being challenged on a Norton. The rider in the saddle is Howard Earle and standing behind
    him with a scarf on is legendary Norton tuner Francis Beart. Beart had been a regular competitor at the track until he opened a small shop on the circuit in 1937 and began tuning other riders machines as well as racing. It was an unusually cold day
    at the track and Brooklands veteran Noel Pope would alternate riding the Norton with Earle for this attempt. Earle would be the first rider and 50 laps into the effort the extra large fuel tank sprung a leak ending their efforts for the day. The next
    morning a second attempt was mustered this time with a standard racing tank fitted. The weather had improved some what but Earle was unable maintain the speeds achieved the previous day so Beart signaled him in and Pope took over. Noel Pope was able
    to increase the speed and get a record setting pace going until a misfire set in and lap times began to fall. Already at a disadvantage, the team would require an extra refueling stop do to the smaller fuel tank having been fitted. But as luck would
    have it a new spark plug fixed the problem and Pope was back on the track reaching even greater lap times. As the 3 hour mark was reached a new average lap speed record of 93mph was set including pit stops! Pope came in exhausted from riding the rough

Alcyon was founded by Edmond Gentil at Neuilly sur Seine in 1902 to manufacture bicycles. In 1904 the factory assembled its first motorcycle, it was equipped
    with a Swiss Zedel single cylinder 350cc engine, from the firm of Zurcher &amp; Luthi in St. Aubin. The Zédel name came from the initials of the two founders of the firm, Ernest Zürcher and Hermann Luthi. The company's main sales were made in France,
    so in 1905, the partners established a French subsidiary just over the border in Pontarlier to avoid customs duties. Alcyon was among the first motorcycle makers to use overhead-valves in their racing machines even four valves per cylinder as early
    as 1912. In 1912 Alcyon entered two machines in the Isle of Man TT races with 348cc single-cylinder engines that featured two inlet valves and two exhaust valves. Unfortunatelyly both bikes failed to finish the Junior TT race. Alcyon turned their
    factory over to repairing airplanes during WWI. After the war, their first model was a 1914 cc four-cylinder car which performed quite well in competition but didn't sell well. Alcyon eventually abandoned car production. This Alcyon motorcycle is
    fitted with a forward-mounted magneto by Thomann and Labor (two marques belonging to the Gentil group). The engine was lubricated by hand pumping the plunger fitted on the right side of the tank to get oil into the crankcase. What looks like a v-belt
    wheel sheave on the rear is actually a rear wheel brake. the French Zédel factory was purchased by Alcyon in 1907 and subsequently most Alcyon motorcycles would be equipped with Zédel engines with the exception of 1925 when J.A.P. engines were also
    fitted in some models. After 1945 mostly light motorcycles, scooters and mopeds were produced, Peugeot took over the company in 1954.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="133"><!-- react-empty: 134

</picture><p>The Honda RC142 twin and the Mondial GP 125 single don't look similar but there is a connection. Soichiro Honda and his young engineer Kiyoshi Kawashima were very impressed with the european GP machines and especially the Mondial 125 single. The dohc
    racer was designed in 1948 by Alfredo Drusiani for Mondial's Count Giuseppe Boselli. The four-stroke alloy unit-construction engine had twin overhead camshafts driven by a shaft-and-bevel system, with an outside flywheel, and straight-cut primary
    gears. It produced 11hp with a bore and stroke of 53x56mm, with 9.7:1 compression. By 1957, with some help from designer Fabio Taglioni, the dohc Mondial had a dual plug head and was producing 19hp at 13,200rpm! After winning the first three places
    in the 1957 250cc championship and taking the 125cc title Mondial with other italian manufacturers withdrew from grand prix racing. Soichiro Honda contacted Mondial about the possibility of aquiring one of the now obsolete 125engines. To his surprise
    Mondial agreed and an engine was shipped off to Japan. Kiyoshi Kawashima and Honda gained a great deal of knowledge from the now three year old Mondial design and applied that to the Honda RC142 works machine.</p><p>ref: Honda V4: The Complete Four-Stroke Story By Greg Pullen</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="172"><!-- react-empty: 173 --></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-45bb6945-62e4-42a0-9598-f0235d6b1aef" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="174"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="175"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="176"><a class=" " href="rene-gillard-photo-won-the-grand-prix-of-lyon-on-a-peugeot" data-reactid="177"><div class="Cover ov-h " data-reactid="178"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="179"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/deadcc57349fa03a9761ab21245c91a9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5e152fe1-ca02-4ae7-918d-a0aec6004896.jpg&amp;width=625" style="object-position:50.080000000000005% 48.926767676767675%;" data-reactid="180"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/deadcc57349fa03a9761ab21245c91a9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5e152fe1-ca02-4ae7-918d-a0aec6004896.jpg&amp;width=625" style="object-position:50.080000000000005% 48.926767676767675%;" data-reactid="181"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/deadcc57349fa03a9761ab21245c91a9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5e152fe1-ca02-4ae7-918d-a0aec6004896.jpg&amp;width=625" style="object-position:50.080000000000005% 48.926767676767675%;" data-reactid="182"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2da28fac460e52e16c225ad9f7e42485/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5e152fe1-ca02-4ae7-918d-a0aec6004896.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.080000000000005% 48.926767676767675%;" data-reactid="183"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="625" data-height="792" data-ratio="0.7891414141414141" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/deadcc57349fa03a9761ab21245c91a9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5e152fe1-ca02-4ae7-918d-a0aec6004896.jpg&amp;width=625" style="object-position:50.080000000000005% 48.926767676767675%;" data-reactid="184"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="185"><!-- react-empty: 186 --><!-- react-empty: 187 --><!-- react-empty: 188 --><!-- react-empty: 189 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="190"><!-- react-text: 191 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m " data-reactid="192"><p data-reactid="193">René Gillard</p></div><a class=" " href="rene-gillard-photo-won-the-grand-prix-of-lyon-on-a-peugeot" data-reactid="194"><!-- react-empty: 195 --></a><!-- react-empty: 196 --><!-- react-empty: 197 --></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="198"><p>René Gillard (photo) won the Grand Prix of Lyon on a Peugeot 500 twin in 1921, 1923 and 1924.

The course consisted of muddy country roads around the Rambouillet countryside, Delvaux won and the 500M was the only 500cc machine to finish the race. Factory mechanic and rider Paul Pean entered the machine in a A.F.C. organized 'Records Day" speed event at Fontainebleau. Pean (photo) set a flying kilometer record in the 500cc class of 122.2 km/h (75.9mph) and 121.205 km/h for the mile. If not for the start of WWI the 500M would have been entered in the French GP. Development was discontinued and in 1915 Ernest Henry left Peugeot.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GhostedColumn-5ae31bd0-1259-4ce3-850f-3d56195ea9ae" class="Section

completely redesigned the Peugeot 500M discarding the fragile gear driven double over head cam design, opting instead for a simpler bevel shaft driven design with a single camshaft and two valves per cylinder. On July 22nd 1923 René Gillard (photo) won the 500cc class at the French Grand Prix on the redesigned SOHC Peugeot at Circuit de Saint-André-de-Corcy in Lyon. Peugeot entered three riders in the 1924 Isle of Man TT on the new 500 twins, Pierre Péan, Jéan Richards, and René Gillard. While the machines were fast the riders were inexperienced on the 37 mile TT course and the machines were poorly suited for the TT circuit, especially the forks. Pean finished 11th, Richards 14th and Gillard had to retire. The Peugeot two-cylinder motorcycles were raced officially until 1927.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="258"><p>photo: National Library of France</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-76540afe-61a4-4207-9106-932923d9d5f7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="259"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="260"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="261"><a class=" " href="winners-of-the-first-sidecar-race-at-the-isle-of-man-in-1923" data-reactid="262"><div class="Cover ov-h " data-reactid="263"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="264"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5695b44d0a896b4ef35d7d95221cbcd0/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5502dd06-aca4-4c50-818e-ce6b713c8ad4.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:44.128787878787875% 18.55241264559068%;" data-reactid="265"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5695b44d0a896b4ef35d7d95221cbcd0/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5502dd06-aca4-4c50-818e-ce6b713c8ad4.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:44.128787878787875% 18.55241264559068%;" data-reactid="266"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8db5afbab293264213f9ecc85d5254a6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5502dd06-aca4-4c50-818e-ce6b713c8ad4.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:44.128787878787875% 18.55241264559068%;" data-reactid="267"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c85429908ac9787e774039a277d1494b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5502dd06-aca4-4c50-818e-ce6b713c8ad4.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:44.128787878787875% 18.55241264559068%;" data-reactid="268"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="601" data-ratio="1.3178036605657237" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5695b44d0a896b4ef35d7d95221cbcd0/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5502dd06-aca4-4c50-818e-ce6b713c8ad4.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:44.128787878787875% 18.55241264559068%;" data-reactid="269"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="270"><!-- react-empty: 271 --><!-- react-empty: 272 --><!-- react-empty: 273 --><!-- react-empty: 274 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="275"><!-- react-text: 276 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m " data-reactid="277"><p data-reactid="278">Freddie Dixon and passenger Walter Denny</p></div><a class=" " href="winners-of-the-first-sidecar-race-at-the-isle-of-man-in-1923" data-reactid="279"><!-- react-empty: 280 --></a><!-- react-empty: 281 --><!-- react-empty: 282 --></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="283"><p>Winners of the first sidecar race at the Isle of Man in 1923 "Flying Freddie" Dixon and passenger Walter Denny.

The 2 mile wooden oval track was located north of Cincinnati between Crescentville and Mosteller roads in Sharonville. The track opened September 4, 1916 and was a copy of the Chicago Speedway Park with a wooden surface 60 feet wide on the homestretch, 70 feet wide in the turns and 50 feet wide on the backstretch. The turns were banked at 19 degrees and reached 33 degrees at the very top. By 1917 the world was at war and the big three motorcycle involved in racing (Harley Davidson, Indian and Excelsior) had signed an agreement to suspend support for racing until the end of WWI. Factory support was still available for endurance runs and sanctioned speed challenges. Just four weeks prior Red Pankhurst riding for Harley Davidson had set new records and Cannonball Baker and Indian were determined to retake the 24 hour record. WWI was in full swing and the First Ohio Regiment under Colonel Galbraith, some 1,500 soldier were encamped at the track and I'm sure eager to watch the attempt. Baker would go after the 12 and 24 hour solo records and Teddy Carroll and George Von Staden would attack the sidecar records both would also set 500 and 1000 mile records. Both machines were on the track at the same time and three stops were made during the first 500 miles. The track was especially dangerous at night with very little lighting and close to midnight it started raining making the wood surface extremely slippery. The rain forced Baker to ride without googles and a bug struck him in the left eye. Not being able to see well Baker mis-judged a turn and slammed into the guard rail sending him and his machine sliding across the track for two hundred feet at 60 miles an hour. Luckily the bike suffered only a broken footboard and Baker was walked over to the First Regiments field hospital where his eye was attended to and he suffered only a bruised shoulder and some abrasions. Teddy and George pulled off the track as well and both machines were equipped with new lights. They were back on the track and back at it in 23 and a half minutes. By 2 o'clock the rain finally stopped and the men really started to pick-up speed again. The 1000 mile mark was reached at 16:14:15 on the solo and at 18:48:30 for the sidecar. It was a big boost for the Hendee factory and Indian touted the records in their advertising with pride. The last racing event held at the Cincinnati Speedway was a 48 hour endurance race for Essex Automobiles held in December of 1919. The Speedway was abandoned and dismantled with the lumber shipped to Chillicothe, Ohio to be used in the construction of Camp Sherman, one of the new training camps for the War effort. The camp was built on top of Hopewell Native American mounds in the area which were bulldozed to make way for the 1,370 buildings constructed at Camp Sherman. The camp also housed German prisoners of war, POWs remained at Camp Sherman until September 1919, several months after the war had ended.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"87f8ba78-3364-40fd-81c8-85511f097695","item":"8341d551-41af-46dc-965d-15902cd84ea6","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_caption":"\"Cannonball\" Baker and Teddy Carrol","_html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker and Teddy Carrol\">","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","_caption":"\"Cannonball\" Baker and Teddy Carrol"},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/768a3eb1020bc3dcd468b5fe50c78720/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/fd38a111edb09179b79105d733e5e224.png","ratio":"88:57","aspect":1.543859649122807,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":513,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/768a3eb1020bc3dcd468b5fe50c78720/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/768a3eb1020bc3dcd468b5fe50c78720/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5b8f57c18876ac262c8cf1d04ddde71e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d47badb64a9779f5c8e0e43316ec41f3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2fcc8d0c-086d-4fea-92bf-b10cf57d0a49.jpg&width=360"}],"faces":[{"x":88,"y":104,"width":38,"height":38,"confidence":5.021157},{"x":475,"y":156,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.016856},{"x":704,"y":71,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.011931},{"x":445,"y":62,"width":30,"height":30,"confidence":5.006675},{"x":552,"y":69,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.005621},{"x":370,"y":80,"width":26,"height":26,"confidence":5.004478},{"x":127,"y":3,"width":24,"height":24,"confidence":4.999186}],"colors":[[226,217,202],[164,151,134],[39,30,23],[138,125,109],[107,94,78]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[1,60],[757,512]],"confidence":0.216932,"center":[383,276],"radius":404.487},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"2e249fa3-7e88-4b4f-bb91-c6e7945de77e","item":"8341d551-41af-46dc-965d-15902cd84ea6","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"\"Cannonball\" Baker and Teddy Carroll set motorcycle endurance and speed records at the Cincinnati Speedway in August of 1917.

The Dutchman Jan DeVries riding a Van Veen - Kreidler was one of his main rivals.

The 50cc GP heats up with Kreidler also supporting racers Barry Sheene and Jarno Saarinen and Derbi adding Gilberto Parlotti for 1971.
