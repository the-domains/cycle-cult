<p>Charles Bayly Franklin began racing Indian motorcycles in 1910. Billy Wells began importing Indians into the UK in May of 1909 at the urging of George Hendee. Billy was familiar with the Irishman because Charles was on the British team for the Coupe International races of 1905. He competed on a "special" of his own design powered by a J.A.P. V-twin engine and although he failed to finish the race,he became the first Irishman to participate in international motorcycle competition. Franklin was also on the British International team in 1906 with the Collier brothers Harry and Charlie on their Matchless'. He missed out on the inaugural Isle of Man TT race in 1907 but competed in the 1908 IOM on another of his JAP engined "specials" this time a single cylinder machine with which he took 6th place. For the 1909 TT Franklin rode a Triumph motorcycle placing 5th. The 1909 TT was the second year Indian V-Twins raced the TT and Guy Lee Evans's close second place finish against the Collier brothers and their Matchless' may have convinced Charles that Indian motorcycles were the way to go. Whatever his reasons Franklin entered the 1910 TT as a privateer on an Indian V-twin with the support of Billy Wells the UK importer. Even though he didn't finish the race (crashing into a stone wall) Franklin was still impressed with the Indian enough to return to England, quit his day job at the Rathmines power station and become an Indian motorcycle dealer. And thus began Charles Franklin's journey with Indian motorcycles. Charles would go on to design motorcycles for Indian including the original Indian Scout of 1920, the original Indian Chief of 1922, and the Indian 101 Scout of 1928.<br>ref:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Franklin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Franklin</a></p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
