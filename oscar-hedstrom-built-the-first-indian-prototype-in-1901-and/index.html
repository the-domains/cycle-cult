Both Hedström and Hendee were bicycle racers before joining forces. George Hendee was the National Amateur High Wheel Champion in the US from 1882 thru 1886. After Hendee retired from professional racing he began selling bicycles and in 1897 he started his own manufacturing company in Springfield, Massachusetts. Oscar Hedström was a Swedish immigrant, a journeyman watchmaker and amateur bicycle racer. In his spare time Oscar built professional track bicycles. One of Hedström's cycle racing partners around 1896 was C.S. Henshaw who was touring the country racing bicycles with sponsorship provided by a tire manufacturer. In 1897 Henshaw met Kenneth Skinner who campaigned a De Dion engine powered tricycle and had just opened a dealership. Henshaw went to work for Skinner doing public motorcycle exhibitions at velodromes with renowned French racer, Henry Fournier. Over 150 different motorcycle and automobile manufacturers licensed the De Dion engine and Skinner was the sole US importer. In 1899 C.S. Henshaw teamed up with Oscar Hedström to build De Dion powered motor-paced racing cycles for Stayer bicycle racing on the high banked velodromes. Pacers were designed to split the wind for the bicyclists (Stayer) who rode in their draft while attempting speed records. It was at a Stayer race at Madison Square Garden in 1900 that George Hendee first saw one of the Henshaw-Hedström motorized tandem pacers. Impressed with the performance, George met with Oscar and posed the idea of building a lightweight motorcycle for everyday transportation of their own design. The two men became partners and by early spring of 1901 the first prototype machine was ready for testing. The photo here is from 1910 and shows an Indian V-twin setup as a pacer. Indian produced their first v-twin factory racer in 1905 and their first production V-twin was sold to the public in 1907. Oscar Hedström wasn't just content to design motorcycles, in 1903, he rode an Indian to a record 56 miles per hour on Ormond Beach in Florida. He continued attempting and coordinating record top-speed runs through the end of the decade. Oscar Hedström resigned from the Indian Motorcycle Company on March 24th 1913 after a disagreement with the board regarding dubious practices to inflate the company's stock values.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
