</picture><p>In May of 1952 a pair of Vincent Black Shadows were prepared for a 24-Hour speed record attempt at the Montlhéry autodrome just south of Paris. The fuel tank held enough gas for an hour and a half at the flat out speed reached on the banking. There were
    four riders that would rotate every hour and a half in the saddle. In this photo Vic Willoughby is standing behind the bike waiting his turn to ride. In Vic's own words "I tucked my elbows in and got my chin down. Took a look at the speedo on the
    straight: showed a hundred and thirty. Around the banking." But things would soon go south for Vic and the Shadow " I'm going round and round, everything going nicely, getting the thumbs-up - that was about the only signal from the pits - when all
    of a sudden, on the banking at just over a hundred and twenty mph, the bike locked solid as could be and i just got the clutch out, weaving all over the bloody place. Jesus, my heart was in my mouth as I pulled in!" The roller big end had seized up
    on the bike and Vincent's hopes of breaking the record were dashed. The Montlhéry Shadows were promoted as production roadsters rather than racing specials and as such used the standard bearings, had the factory used caged roller bearing big ends
    made by Alpha like George Brown used in his "Nero" and "Super Nero" sprinters the results might have been different. Vincent still ended up going home from France with eight other speed records.<br>ref:<a href="http://johnlumleyaffair.blogspot.fr/p/montlhery-black-shadows.html">http://johnlumleyaffair.blogspot.fr/p/montlhery-black-shadows.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-28f05258-e0e5-486d-a496-7b87711c44f8" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="17"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="18"><a class=" " href="on-october-21st-1937-between-the-80th-and-82nd-kilometres-o" data-reactid="19"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="20"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="21"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1d9b8e026cbe604e61b72156c8454787/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51b454cc-5972-47b9-b7fa-1b5f9654366c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:45.83333333333333% 20.314735336194563%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1d9b8e026cbe604e61b72156c8454787/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51b454cc-5972-47b9-b7fa-1b5f9654366c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:45.83333333333333% 20.314735336194563%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/91ccd5e965c20ae90de353d93527506a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51b454cc-5972-47b9-b7fa-1b5f9654366c.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:45.83333333333333% 20.314735336194563%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a874d8b9cd5298f4727abe7898cd01d1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51b454cc-5972-47b9-b7fa-1b5f9654366c.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:45.83333333333333% 20.314735336194563%;" data-reactid="25"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="792" data-height="699" data-ratio="1.1330472103004292" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1d9b8e026cbe604e61b72156c8454787/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F51b454cc-5972-47b9-b7fa-1b5f9654366c.jpg&amp;width=792" style="object-position:45.83333333333333% 20.314735336194563%;" data-reactid="26"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><!-- react-empty: 32 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="33"><p>On October 21st 1937, between the 80th and 82nd kilometres of the Brescia-Bergamo stretch of motorway, Piero Taruffi’s Gilera Rondine covered the flying kilometer in just 13.13 seconds at a record-breaking speed of 274.481 km/h (170.555 mph). In 1935 Taruffi had reached a speed of 244.5 km/h (151.925 mph) with an unfaired version of the Rondine and for this latest attempt he used the Caproni aircraft wind tunnel to develop a completely enclosed fairing. Taruffi was an engineer and the technical director at Gilera, Italy’s oldest motorcycle manufacturer, he would also become a top Formula One driver. The Rondine (Swallow) is considered the first motorcycle of the modern era.

</picture><p>The winner of the first Isle of Man motorcycle Tourist Trophy was Charlie Collier on a single-cylinder 432cc J.A. Prestwich Industries (JAP) powered Matchless motorcycle. Henry Collier Sr. had a bicycle factory in Plumstead that did quite well manufacturing
    bicycles under the "Matchless" brand for the British Army. Henry's sons Bert, Charlie and Harry Jr. joined the business and by 1899, Collier &amp;Sons was experimenting with small engines mounted to a traditional bicycle. This 1904 photo is of Charlie
    and his brother Harry at the Olympia velodrome testing one of the early De Dion based engine designs. Charlie and Harry were returning from the 1906 International Cup Races in Austria by train when the idea of establishing a motorcycle race on the
    Isle of Man was first discussed. The inaugural Tourist Trophy race was held on May 28, 1907 and the Matchless entry was a 432cc single-cylinder JAP motor making 3 ½ horsepower ridden by Charlie Collier. The first TT had 25 entrants, 18 single cylinder
    and 7 twin cylinder machines. The race course was rough over roads that were little more than horse and buggy trails. Charlie managed to win the race at an average speed of 38.21 mph with a total time of 4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 seconds. Rem Fowler
    riding a 684cc 5-horsepower Peugeot-engined Norton came in second a good 13 minutes behind the Matchless. Norton later contested the win because Charlie had used his pedals whenever possible. Triumph's Jack Marshall also protested claiming that he
    had the fastest time when stops for repairs were deducted. Charlie Collier and Matchless's victory would be upheld, but for the 1908 TT race pedal gears were prohibited.<br>ref:<a href="http://ijms.nova.edu/November2007TT/IJMS_Artcl.Ward.html">http://ijms.nova.edu/November2007TT/IJMS_Artcl.Ward.html</a><br>ref:

</picture><p>American board track legend Jacob (Jake) De Rosier was the favorite to win the 1911 Isle of Man TT, but after leading the first lap, he crashed several times and lost his tools and spares on the rough IOM course. Jake was forced to borrow a spark plug
    to complete the race and was disqualified for accepting help with repairs at his refueling station (a violation of the rules). Indian sponsored fivebikes in the 1911 Isle of Man TT races and even with De Rosier's disqualification Indian became the
    first foreign manufacturer to win the TT sweeping the top three positions in what would become known as the "Indian Massacre" at the Isle of Man. De Rosier was born in Quebec in 1880 and his family moved to the U.S. when he was four. De Rosier took
    up bicycle racing in his teens becoming one of the top racers in New England by 1897. Jake was fascinated with the bicycle pacing machines used at the velodromes of era. He befriended Henri Fournier the Frenchman responsible for introducing motor
    paced racing to the U.S. and was able convince Henri to let him pilot one of the machines. Fournier was impressed with Jake's skill at riding one of these beasts which was no small feat. De Rosier was hired by Fournier and became one of the best pacing
    riders in Paris and other tracks around the world. It was at an American velodrome that Jake met Oscar Hedström and was offered to ride for Indian, becoming one of the first factory-backed motorcycle racers. De Rosier started winning endurance runs
    and bicycle velodrome track races on an Indian and in 1908 he was the top rider in the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM). By the end of 1911 Jake held every FAM speed record for professional riders. De Rosier won nearly 900 races during his
    racing career and was undoubtedly the most famous motorcycle racer of the early 20th century.<br>ref:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeRosier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeRosier</a><br>ref:<a href="http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?RacerID=95">http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?RacerID=95</a><br>ref:

</picture><p>What If I told you that the designer of the original Indian Motorcycle, Oscar Hedström whipped out a revolver and fired it during a race in 1904?...well it's true! George Hendee and Oscar Hedström were both participants in the inaugural F.A.M. (Federation
    of American Motorcyclists) annual meet. The event started on Saturday July 1904 with a 271 mile endurance race from New York City to Albany and back. Oscar Hedström was chased by a dog at one point in the race and unable to out run the dog on his
    1 3/4 hp Indian he pulled out a revolver and shot at the dog! This is the quote published in the July addition of The Automobile, "Oscar Hedström was annoyed by a yelping dog on the out-ward journey and tried to give the beast a dose of bird-shot
    from a revolver, holding the weapon in his right hand and aiming it backward under his left arm". Apparently, Hedström suffered powder burns in his armpit but still finished the race in good time.<br>The FAM meet was a week long affair with several
    competitions including a fuel economy run, hillclimb races, a quick starting competition and a slow race. Another interesting requirement of the event was that no repairs other than roadside adjustments could be made to the machines. The motorcycles
    were impounded each night and as a result the same equipment was used for each competition thus leveling the playing field with no special preparations allowed for a particular event. George Hendee, Oscars co-founder of Indian Motorcycles also competed
    in some of the events. Hendee came in third in the economy run having traveled 42.1 miles on a single quart of gasoline. The Automobile article remarked that " George M. Hendee, also on an Indian, covered 42.1 miles, which is a good showing in view
    of the fact that the rider weighs over 240 pounds". Oscar Hedström won the hillclimb races with a 1:03 minute time.<br>The FAM was officially formed on September 7, 1903 during a meeting of 93 enthusiasts at a clubhouse in Brooklyn. The Motorcycle
    Manufacturers Association, formed in 1908 and the Motorcycle and Allied Trades Association was formed in 1916. By 1924 the M&amp;ATA had registered over 10,000 riders that same year they created a division called the "American Motorcycle Association"
    to control rider registration, activities, and issue sanctions for national events. As of April 30, 2015 the AMA has 214,517 members.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="44"><!-- react-empty: 45 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-6e921f4e-8ea3-4a12-9ec7-16bd8e4e2dbd" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="46"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="47"><picture>

</picture><p>Jack Marshall (photographed here at Brooklands) won the 1908 Isle of Man TT’s single-cylinder class on a 3 1/2 hp Triumph having finished second in the inaugural race the year before behind Charlie Collier and his Matchless. Triumph riders Jack Marshall
    and Freddie Hulbert had placed second and third in the first motorcycle TT race. In fact Marshall protested Collier's win claiming that his Triumph had the fastest time when stops for repairs were deducted. Pedal gears were prohibited and the fuel
    regulations were changed for the 1908 TT. Singles were restricted to 100 miles to the gallon and twins to 80 miles. Triumph's reputation for quality and dependability were becoming well-established and Jack's TT win in 1908 boosted sales considerably.
    In the previous years TT race, most entries were single cylinder machines but for 1908 over half the entries were twin and multi cylinder machines such as the 4 cylinder Belgian F.N. Single and multi cylinder machines were decided into separate classes
    for 1908. Marshall grabbed an early led of the singles, but lost it to Charlie Collier when he crashed at Kirk Michael on the first lap. Jack lost even more ground when he stopped to change a broken exhaust valve and mend a tire puncture. His rival
    Charlie Collier was having his own problems and having stopped to change a sparkplug. Harry Reed was leading the multi cylinder class on a Peugeot-engined DOT. Late in the race in front of the 2,000 spectators at St. John's, Jack Marshall overtook
    the lead from Collier winning the race by two minutes. Jack's average speed was 40.49 mph Harry Reed won the multi cylinder class but the average speed of the winning twin was slower than that of the Jack's Triumph single. The win stimulated sales
    with around Triumph 3,000 motorcycles being produced in 1909. Triumph's reputation was such that at the onset of WW1 in 1914 the British army placed an order for 30,000 motorcycles for the war effort.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="48"><!-- react-empty: 49 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-d913343d-65bb-45a7-bd28-4fd4242aa2a7" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="50"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="51"><picture>

</picture><p>In the spring of 1921 Harley-Davidson and Indian were in a battle to become the first to attain 100mph in England. Bert Le Vack had joined the Hendee Manufacturing team in late 1920 and was keen to take the record. Le Vack helped Indian sort out the eight
    valve Powerplus engine and despite being a 1912 Charles Franklin design he was able to make an unofficial run of 103 mph at Brooklands on alcohol based fuel. Harley-Davidson failed at their first attempt and Indian was in a position grab the record
    with a officially timed run. But during the timed run a cam follower broke destroying the timing case taking a pushrod with it. Burt and the Indian crew worked through the night to repair the engine but the following day the timekeepers were unavailable
    thanks to a misunderstanding and before another run could be rescheduled Harley-Davidson had achieved the 100 mph record. Le Vack was very upset but the following day the timekeepers were ready and Bert raised the one-way kilometre record to 106.65
    mph and later to 107.55 on officially timed runs. Bert was with Indian for four years but after the record attempts he reached out to John Prestwich at JAP in what some say was a renewed sense of patriotism in hopes of putting a British made big twin

</picture><p>Standing on the concrete at Brooklands on March 20th 1911, this forlorn looking racer is Oliver Cyril Godfrey. He is 23 years old and living with his mother in northwest London but his luck is about to change. Billy Wells of the Hendee Mfg Co.’s London
    branch has just received word that Oscar Hedstrom, Indian's big boss has entered five bikes in the 1911 Isle of Man TT races. Jake DeRosier, ArthurMoorhouse and Charles Franklin are the factory works riders but Indian also decided to support two privateers,
    Jake Alexander and Oliver. This isn't Indian's first TT, Indian rider Lee Evans finished second in 1909 and Jake Alexander managed to place 14th in 1910. But this year is different, 1911 will be the first year motorcycles are allowed to compete on
    the full 37.5-mile Mountain Course. In previous years motorcycles competed on an abbreviated circuit because they weren’t able to climb Snaefell Mountain. Most motorcycle of the day were still using direct-drive leather belts, with variable pulleys
    or planetary-geared hubs but the Indian's had a two-speed countershaft gearbox and chain final drive.<br>The 1911 TT would also be the first year that limits on engine capacity were put in place now featuring new 'Senior' and 'Junior' events. Senior
    machines were limited to a maximum of 595cc (multis) and 500cc (singles) with Juniors permitted 340cc and 300cc respectively. Indian prepared a downsized variation of the standard 633cc 'F-head' roadster engine specially for the TT which incorporated
    overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. Board track legend Jake DeRosier was the favorite to win but he crashed several times and was disqualified for accepting help with repairs at his refueling station (a violation of the rules). Alexander also
    crashed out, but Oliver Godfrey set a new average speed record of 47.63 mph taking first place in the five-lap, 189-mile Senior TT race in 3 hours, 56 minutes and 10 seconds! The second-place finisher Charles Collier riding a Matchless was disqualified
    for illegal refueling giving Charles Franklin second and Arthur Moorhouse third. Indian became the first foreign manufacturer to win the TT and the first ever clean sweep by a factory team. Oliver became the first Senior TT winner, the first to win
    on the Mountain course and would hold the first motorcycle race record on TT's Mountain Circuit. Godfrey would return to the Isle of Man three more times, he failed to start in 1912, he was DNF (did not finish) for 1913, but in 1914 he managed to
    claim 2nd place at the TT.<br>At the outbreak of WWI Godfrey enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps and was posted at Fienvillers France to the 27th Squadron in June of 1916. On September 23rd during the Battle of the Somme, Oliver Godfrey was on an early

</picture><p>This is the motor that changed everything, the inline-four cylinder Rondine. Development started in 1923 with two young engineers Carlo Gianini, Piero Remor and a wealthy businessman Count Bonmartini. The three men formed the company GBR (Gianini-Bonmartini-Remor)to
    manufacture a transverse 4-stroke motorcycle. Their first 490cc engine produced 28 hp at 6000 rpm. By 1928, the company now called Opra (Officine di precisione romana automobilistiche) was in production and the first model was presented at the international
    Auto Show in Milan. The 1928 engine was capable of 34 hp, considerably more powerful than other engines of the time. But further development was needed as the engine suffered failures in the racing events entered. Bonmartini became disenchanted in
    the design and hoped to sell the company but found no buyers, eventually he left and started the aircraft factory C.N.A. Piero Remor also left the company and in 1933 Carlo Gianini enlisted the help of Piero Taruffi to assist him in completely redesigning
    the racing motorcycle. The new motorcycle was named “Rondine” in honor of the Transadriatica airplane that had flown over Rome in 1922. The new design was water-cooled and fitted with a supercharger producing 60hp at 8500 rpm. With a partial fairing
    Taruffi would set a new motorcycle land speed record in 1935 of 244.5 km/h (151.925 mph) in the 500cc class. Count Bonmartini still owned the company and sold it to the Caproni aircraft Company including the Rondine motorcycle package. After aquiring
    the company in 1936 Caproni instructed Taruffi to find a buyer for the Rondine racers. Taruffi contacted Giuseppe Gilera who bought the motorcycles and tooling with the condition that Taruffi would join the Gilera Company. Taruffi and the Rondine
    would go on to break fifty world speed records including 170 mph on the flying kilometer in just 13.13 seconds.<br>ref:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnl.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOPRA&amp;h=JAQElBEmb&amp;enc=AZNESSe3UorO7BcAnxrIRU2cQxwvGC6ELck-CuVVazaBWoEPlu_-kj4Ry4HWd_Cz6shgV_Jhyq7YOGTm1WB443M4FcEetzNlFiCNUizSUSCnQtqO3f9ZHUb4DNakd3IqFFtflJgXOl90W-ImIeYZ0vPw&amp;s=1">https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPRA</a><br>ref:

</picture><p>In post WWII England there were dozens of airfields being used for motorcycle and automotive racing including sprints. Thurleigh, Bedfordshire was originally a RAF base, it was handed over to the US 8th AF, 306th Bombardment Group known as 'The Reich
    wreckers' in September 1942. It was the first base in England to be handed over completely to the Americans allowing them sovereignty and full control over the area. The Group flew 341 daylight missions in B17 Flying Fortresses between October 1942
    and April 1945 and were the first US Bomb group to fly a combat mission over Nazi Germany. Even now Thurleigh is home to FIA Formula 2 races. This is a photo of George Brown's "Nero" at Thurleigh airfield without it's streamlined fairing. George and
    Cliff Brown were early adopters of aerodynamics, finding benefits of up to 20mph even in 1/4 mile sprints. In 1961 on a faired "Nero" George set the Standing Start Kilometre World Record for up to 1000cc machines with a run of 20.505 seconds hitting
    the trap at 108.73 mph. Cliff Brown was able to sort out a misfire in the rear cylinder caused by trapped piston rings the night before Sunday's record attempt. George also set the British Standing Start Kilo Record in 250, 350 and 500cc classes on

The only five hundred mile race every held at Brooklands was won by Le Vack, and he is also noted for winning two two-hundred mile victories at the track on the same day. Before WWI
    he worked for Daimler, Napier, and the London General Omnibus Company. He started racing in 1912 competing in the London to Edinburgh trials race.He competed in the 1914 Isle of Man and when the war broke out he tested and assembled aero engines.
    After the war P.J. Wallace hired Le Vack to work at his small workshop. With Bert, John Wallace built a single cylinder engine of his own design, the single-speed belt-drive "Duzmo". Le Vack won many racing events with the Duzmo even entering it in
    the 1920 London to Edinburgh trial and the Isle of Man. After competing in the IOM Le Vack joined the London Depot of Hendee Manufacturing Co, who made Indian motorcycles in Springfield, Massachusetts. While at 'Indian', Bert was instrumental in developing
    the eight valve Indian engine. Le Vack won the famous 500-Mile Race at Brooklands in 1921 on an Indian Powerplus with an average speed of 107.5 miles per hour! Bert Le Vack favored of using alcohol-based fuels in racing and this brought him to the
    attention of John A. Prestwich in Tottenham in North London, who hired Bert as a designer for his famous JAP racing engines. This is the JAP powered Brough Superior Bert Le Vack set a new world speed record of 119.05 mph at Arpajon, France on 6th
    of July 1924. He returned in 1929 to set a further record for Brough Superior of 129.00 mph on the same works SS100. When J.A. Prestwich closed down his racing department Le Vack moved on to New Hudson and the later to Motosaccoche in Switzerland.
    He was tragically killed testing one of their products in 1931.<br>ref:<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brough-superior.com%2F&amp;h=AAQEZlUcd&amp;enc=AZP_75uuKMvuFne30OeRfDK2H0MAmW5p-HrSg89QFejbGf3ydCmiRqCCX4M1MKPl7nfBCcwFE0JNfqVNo3ulFXAAoCKkTpPIeh-BI9yaCg1HQLbe9_qT9ut88Kl7Hw-O9d51R-SM-5HtqLgpTMqMV_33&amp;s=1">http://www.brough-superior.com/</a><br>ref:

</picture><p>Charles Bayly Franklin began racing Indian motorcycles in 1910. Billy Wells began importing Indians into the UK in May of 1909 at the urging of George Hendee. Billy was familiar with the Irishman because Charles was on the British team for the Coupe International
    races of 1905. He competed on a "special" of his own design powered by a J.A.P. V-twin engine and although he failed to finish the race,he became the first Irishman to participate in international motorcycle competition. Franklin was also on the British
    International team in 1906 with the Collier brothers Harry and Charlie on their Matchless'. He missed out on the inaugural Isle of Man TT race in 1907 but competed in the 1908 IOM on another of his JAP engined "specials" this time a single cylinder
    machine with which he took 6th place. For the 1909 TT Franklin rode a Triumph motorcycle placing 5th. The 1909 TT was the second year Indian V-Twins raced the TT and Guy Lee Evans's close second place finish against the Collier brothers and their
    Matchless' may have convinced Charles that Indian motorcycles were the way to go. Whatever his reasons Franklin entered the 1910 TT as a privateer on an Indian V-twin with the support of Billy Wells the UK importer. Even though he didn't finish the
    race (crashing into a stone wall) Franklin was still impressed with the Indian enough to return to England, quit his day job at the Rathmines power station and become an Indian motorcycle dealer. And thus began Charles Franklin's journey with Indian
    motorcycles. Charles would go on to design motorcycles for Indian including the original Indian Scout of 1920, the original Indian Chief of 1922, and the Indian 101 Scout of 1928.<br>ref:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Franklin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Franklin</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="99"><!-- react-empty: 100 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-0054f491-73b3-438e-9afb-1d6861b2ec68" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="101"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="102"><picture>

</picture><p>Matchless Motorcycles dominated racing on the Isle of Man in the early days. The Tourist Trophy was more of a reliability test than a speed contest at the time. Most entrants would suffer at least one crash and given the primitive machines of the day
    and the poor condition of the roads on the island, tire punctures and mechanical failures were to be expected. The TT organizers recognized this andmade fuel economy part of the program with fuel allotments closely monitored. For the second running
    of the TT in 1908 fuel limits were set and pedal gearing was outlawed. Having won the first ever TT, Matchless would again enter a single cylinder machine with Charlie Collier in the saddle. But it was Jack Marshall riding a Triumph single that would
    win the race with the Matchless coming in second out of the 37 machines entered. For the 1909 TT there would be no fuel consumption limits so Matchless entered a 738cc JAP twin-cylinder machine setting a new lap record of 52.3 mph, this time with
    Harry Collier piloting the motorcycle. His winning time, three hours and thirteen minutes. Charlie Collier won the 1910 TT races as seen in this photograph and Harry Collier came in second out of the field of 80 riders that year. The Collier brothers
    TT wins didn't go unnoticed, the Matchless brand now included a range of single and twin cylinder motorcycles which were in high demand thanks impart to the boys racing successes.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="103"><!-- react-empty: 104 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-603537b4-a90c-42a6-94ef-28c6fb7db2e5" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="105"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="106"><picture>

</picture><p>Guy Lee Evans was already a fast competitor at Brooklands in 1909 when Billy Wells of the Hendee Mfg. Co.'s London depot offered him an Indian Motorcycle to ride. Evans repaid the favor by becoming the first American to win a motorcycle race at Brooklands
    with speed of 64.7 mph in his class (750cc). Evans's 638cc v-twin also won the senior handicap for 1000cc machines! Billy Wells was also a racerhaving competed in the inaugural 1907 Isle of Man TT race. For the 1909 Isle of Man races Billy Wells convinced
    Hendee to support Gordon Fletcher, Guy Lee Evans and himself as riders for the Senior TT. Wells injured himself during practice the day before the race and although he started on race day, he was forced to retire after completing only a couple laps
    due to pain from his injuries. Guy Lee Evans used his two-speed all-chain drive V-twin to great advantage over the belt drive competition, holding the lead for half the race, finishing just a minute or two behind Harry Collier’s Matchless to take
    second. The next year Indian's chief designer Oscar Hedstrom came to observe the TT for Hendee. The Indian works team for 1910 was Guy Lee Evans, Charlie Bennett and Walter Bentley (yeah that Bentley) and Indian supported privateers Arthur Moorhouse,
    Jimmy Alexander and Charles B. Franklin. But luck was against the boys when a batch of Indian supplied inner tubes proved faulty, with several riders crashing due to tire blowouts. Indian's best finishes in 1910 were Jimmy Alexander 14th and Guy Lee
    Evans 21st. Matchless and the Collier brothers were again on the podium with Charlie Collier taking first with an average speed of 50.63 mph and his brother Harry close behind in second place. Later that year Charlie Bennett would win the Brooklands
    60-Lap TT race on an Indian motorcycle with an average speed of 61 mph.<br>ref: Motorcycle Illustrated Sept. 1, 1909</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="107"><!-- react-empty: 108 --></div></section><section id="section-InfiniteScroll-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="109"><span style="font-size:0;" data-reactid="110"></span><div class="Component p-1 color-title color-text " data-reactid="111"><p data-reactid="112">loading ...</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="113"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="114"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="115"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="116"><span data-reactid="117"><!-- react-empty: 118 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="119"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="120">Cycle Cult</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="121"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="122"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="123"><div class="Link" data-reactid="124"><a data-reactid="125"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="126"><a data-reactid="127"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

In 1935 Taruffi had reached a speed of 244.5 km/h (151.925 mph) with an unfaired version of the Rondine and for this latest attempt he used the Caproni aircraft wind tunnel to develop a completely enclosed fairing.

Jake was forced to borrow a spark plug to complete the race and was disqualified for accepting help with repairs at his refueling station (a violation of the rules). Indian sponsored fivebikes in the 1911 Isle of Man TT races and even with De Rosier's disqualification Indian became the first foreign manufacturer to win the TT sweeping the top three positions in what would become known as the \"Indian Massacre\" at the Isle of Man. De Rosier was born in Quebec in 1880 and his family moved to the U.S. when he was four. De Rosier took up bicycle racing in his teens becoming one of the top racers in New England by 1897. Jake was fascinated with the bicycle pacing machines used at the velodromes of era. He befriended Henri Fournier the Frenchman responsible for introducing motor paced racing to the U.S. and was able convince Henri to let him pilot one of the machines. Fournier was impressed with Jake's skill at riding one of these beasts which was no small feat. De Rosier was hired by Fournier and became one of the best pacing riders in Paris and other tracks around the world. It was at an American velodrome that Jake met Oscar Hedström and was offered to ride for Indian, becoming one of the first factory-backed motorcycle racers. De Rosier started winning endurance runs and bicycle velodrome track races on an Indian and in 1908 he was the top rider in the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM). By the end of 1911 Jake held every FAM speed record for professional riders. De Rosier won nearly 900 races during his racing career and was undoubtedly the most famous motorcycle racer of the early 20th century. ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeRosier ref:http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?RacerID=95 ref:http://cmhf.ca/jake-derosier/","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"4a988895-8422-46b3-8e34-077fb319bc5f","item":"8bd1cfdd-fb1a-439a-84f6-340986d63e8a","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c13ef821c0502a868cfe8631cd34a68/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c13ef821c0502a868cfe8631cd34a68/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c01195a504c843a0299d6998575dea31/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/44079df4b92abfa906f5d7bead659cb7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c13ef821c0502a868cfe8631cd34a68/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=792\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c13ef821c0502a868cfe8631cd34a68/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/944e53e798e76d7efdc69400d6e68698.png","ratio":"18:11","aspect":1.6363636363636365,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":484,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c13ef821c0502a868cfe8631cd34a68/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5c13ef821c0502a868cfe8631cd34a68/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c01195a504c843a0299d6998575dea31/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/44079df4b92abfa906f5d7bead659cb7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff544e2ec-a3e0-4617-b670-d60fd5b6485c.jpg&width=360"}],"colors":[[38,29,22],[158,143,124],[191,178,161],[103,90,73],[232,219,202]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[1,1],[791,483]],"confidence":0.183589,"center":[395,287],"radius":453.265},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"cfa02653-e841-4de0-887a-c3e9cda7a9e3","item":"8bd1cfdd-fb1a-439a-84f6-340986d63e8a","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"American board track legend Jacob (Jake) De Rosier was the favorite to win the 1911 Isle of Man TT, but after leading the first lap, he crashed several times and lost his tools and spares on the rough IOM course.

Triumph riders Jack Marshall and Freddie Hulbert had placed second and third in the first motorcycle TT race. In fact Marshall protested Collier's win claiming that his Triumph had the fastest time when stops for repairs were deducted. Pedal gears were prohibited and the fuel regulations were changed for the 1908 TT. Singles were restricted to 100 miles to the gallon and twins to 80 miles. Triumph's reputation for quality and dependability were becoming well-established and Jack's TT win in 1908 boosted sales considerably. In the previous years TT race, most entries were single cylinder machines but for 1908 over half the entries were twin and multi cylinder machines such as the 4 cylinder Belgian F.N. Single and multi cylinder machines were decided into separate classes for 1908. Marshall grabbed an early led of the singles, but lost it to Charlie Collier when he crashed at Kirk Michael on the first lap. Jack lost even more ground when he stopped to change a broken exhaust valve and mend a tire puncture. His rival Charlie Collier was having his own problems and having stopped to change a sparkplug. Harry Reed was leading the multi cylinder class on a Peugeot-engined DOT. Late in the race in front of the 2,000 spectators at St. John's, Jack Marshall overtook the lead from Collier winning the race by two minutes. Jack's average speed was 40.49 mph Harry Reed won the multi cylinder class but the average speed of the winning twin was slower than that of the Jack's Triumph single. The win stimulated sales with around Triumph 3,000 motorcycles being produced in 1909. Triumph's reputation was such that at the onset of WW1 in 1914 the British army placed an order for 30,000 motorcycles for the war effort.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"ea2722dc-fa05-4ebd-a311-7c46eb22716c","item":"6e921f4e-8ea3-4a12-9ec7-16bd8e4e2dbd","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca28c723007805972c8bcbc3967164cd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca28c723007805972c8bcbc3967164cd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4f70d9e5c15d350e516ea5166ef9b6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6c7e0c2ea57a69a9b1a3e9b6561ce332/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca28c723007805972c8bcbc3967164cd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=792\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca28c723007805972c8bcbc3967164cd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/7c7535056bf0685ad7d832d81650bb67.png","ratio":"22:17","aspect":1.2941176470588236,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":612,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca28c723007805972c8bcbc3967164cd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca28c723007805972c8bcbc3967164cd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc4f70d9e5c15d350e516ea5166ef9b6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6c7e0c2ea57a69a9b1a3e9b6561ce332/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0fc0c6e0-77d7-4992-9309-2846cf474129.jpg&width=360"}],"faces":[{"x":292,"y":120,"width":48,"height":48,"confidence":5.024674}],"colors":[[214,201,185],[27,20,14],[150,135,116],[86,73,57],[55,45,35]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[243,137],[654,590]],"confidence":0.226218,"center":[417,376],"radius":260.863},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"35b106c0-e5b2-486b-a831-7d2f8b83a7ad","item":"6e921f4e-8ea3-4a12-9ec7-16bd8e4e2dbd","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Jack Marshall (photographed here at Brooklands) won the 1908 Isle of Man TT’s single-cylinder class on a 3 1/2 hp Triumph having finished second in the inaugural race the year before behind Charlie Collier and his Matchless.

This isn't Indian's first TT, Indian rider Lee Evans finished second in 1909 and Jake Alexander managed to place 14th in 1910. But this year is different, 1911 will be the first year motorcycles are allowed to compete on the full 37.5-mile Mountain Course. In previous years motorcycles competed on an abbreviated circuit because they weren’t able to climb Snaefell Mountain. Most motorcycle of the day were still using direct-drive leather belts, with variable pulleys or planetary-geared hubs but the Indian's had a two-speed countershaft gearbox and chain final drive. The 1911 TT would also be the first year that limits on engine capacity were put in place now featuring new 'Senior' and 'Junior' events.

The second-place finisher Charles Collier riding a Matchless was disqualified for illegal refueling giving Charles Franklin second and Arthur Moorhouse third. Indian became the first foreign manufacturer to win the TT and the first ever clean sweep by a factory team.

On September 23rd during the Battle of the Somme, Oliver Godfrey was on an early morning bombing raid over Cambrai when he was spotted by a \"Jagdstaffel 2\" hunter squadron of the the German Imperial Army Air Service and shot down.

F. 12. at Point-du-jour Military Cemetery, Athies, near Arras.<br>ref:<a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdaveroperracing.blogspot.com%2Fp%2Foliver-cyril-godfrey-first-mountain.html&amp;h=VAQErR7SR&amp;enc=AZNv5AS2L5I6IZ_0YGuX-6S1HM0aE-ibeZC_agjEo6EnLmdnGjf2LJ8fdFJpO0qYbnCvm0oROFYMmXfN-aQ8hzCgjmuZeJa2VeMAJkIEThr7RMlgP6zMKpH-YBdaz11_E3YFrpq3DRI8IImQ4kcUl2Su&amp;s=1\">http://daveroperracing.blogspot.com/p/oliver-cyril-godfrey-first-mountain.html</a><br>ref:<a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19290/lot/397/\">https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19290/lot/397/</a><br>ref:<a href=\"http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/blogs/first-american-motorcycle-to-win-isle-man-tt-indian-island-icon?image=2\">http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/blogs/first-american-motorcycle-to-win-isle-man-tt-indian-island-icon?image=2</a></p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"4bdb4da5-9015-4595-bca5-3bf03d5988cb":{"id":"4bdb4da5-9015-4595-bca5-3bf03d5988cb","index":10,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-24T03:33:20.187Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T07:03:01.595Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-24-this-is-the-motor-that-changed-everything-the-inline-four-c.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"this-is-the-motor-that-changed-everything-the-inline-four-c/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"This is the motor that changed everything, the inline-four cylinder Rondine. Development started in 1923 with two young engineers Carlo Gianini, Piero Remor and a wealthy businessman Count Bonmartini. The three men formed the company GBR (Gianini-Bonmartini-Remor)to manufacture a transverse 4-stroke motorcycle. Their first 490cc engine produced 28 hp at 6000 rpm. By 1928, the company now called Opra (Officine di precisione romana automobilistiche) was in production and the first model was presented at the international Auto Show in Milan. The 1928 engine was capable of 34 hp, considerably more powerful than other engines of the time. But further development was needed as the engine suffered failures in the racing events entered. Bonmartini became disenchanted in the design and hoped to sell the company but found no buyers, eventually he left and started the aircraft factory C.N.A. Piero Remor also left the company and in 1933 Carlo Gianini enlisted the help of Piero Taruffi to assist him in completely redesigning the racing motorcycle. The new motorcycle was named “Rondine” in honor of the Transadriatica airplane that had flown over Rome in 1922. The new design was water-cooled and fitted with a supercharger producing 60hp at 8500 rpm. With a partial fairing Taruffi would set a new motorcycle land speed record in 1935 of 244.5 km/h (151.925 mph) in the 500cc class. Count Bonmartini still owned the company and sold it to the Caproni aircraft Company including the Rondine motorcycle package. After aquiring the company in 1936 Caproni instructed Taruffi to find a buyer for the Rondine racers. Taruffi contacted Giuseppe Gilera who bought the motorcycles and tooling with the condition that Taruffi would join the Gilera Company. Taruffi and the Rondine would go on to break fifty world speed records including 170 mph on the flying kilometer in just 13.13 seconds. ref:https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPRA ref:http://www.italianways.com/the-gilera-rondine-500-unrivaled-power/","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"2f8abf3c-f309-43c8-b63d-2e93a91f4f67","item":"4bdb4da5-9015-4595-bca5-3bf03d5988cb","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a33696169a59f0b153d797304a93a26d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a33696169a59f0b153d797304a93a26d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=792\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dff1439d0f49a054d195fa2f8754243c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b7f34f101ad151596d662bf5afb7f986/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a33696169a59f0b153d797304a93a26d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=792\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg","starred":true,"_description":"","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a33696169a59f0b153d797304a93a26d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=792","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/12b08865320aa710c28410927b77602e.png","ratio":"264:181","aspect":1.4585635359116023,"orientation":"landscape","width":792,"height":543,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a33696169a59f0b153d797304a93a26d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=792"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a33696169a59f0b153d797304a93a26d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=792"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dff1439d0f49a054d195fa2f8754243c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b7f34f101ad151596d662bf5afb7f986/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe9e51ea1-22b0-4b3b-a21f-e8896a862e8a.jpg&width=360"}],"colors":[[4,3,1],[201,188,171],[145,130,111],[99,86,70],[60,50,40]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[264,45],[705,483]],"confidence":0.166013,"center":[483,281],"radius":259.473},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"3a0f9d90-d0c4-4c3a-9147-fd48c484b243","item":"4bdb4da5-9015-4595-bca5-3bf03d5988cb","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"This is the motor that changed everything, the inline-four cylinder Rondine.

Even now Thurleigh is home to FIA Formula 2 races. This is a photo of George Brown's \"Nero\" at Thurleigh airfield without it's streamlined fairing. George and Cliff Brown were early adopters of aerodynamics, finding benefits of up to 20mph even in 1/4 mile sprints. In 1961 on a faired \"Nero\" George set the Standing Start Kilometre World Record for up to 1000cc machines with a run of 20.505 seconds hitting the trap at 108.73 mph. Cliff Brown was able to sort out a misfire in the rear cylinder caused by trapped piston rings the night before Sunday's record attempt. George also set the British Standing Start Kilo Record in 250, 350 and 500cc classes on an Ariel Arrow special supplied to him by the Selly Oak company that same weekend!<br>ref:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Thurleigh\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Thurleigh</a><br>ref:<a href=\"http://vincent.gkhost.co.uk/George-Brown\">http://vincent.gkhost.co.uk/George-Brown</a></p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"fc1e0d11-5c16-476f-870d-5335c95bf9fa":{"id":"fc1e0d11-5c16-476f-870d-5335c95bf9fa","index":12,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-24T03:44:26.234Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T06:47:39.103Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-24-bert-herbert-le-vack-earned-the-nickname-the-wizard-of-br.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"bert-herbert-le-vack-earned-the-nickname-the-wizard-of-br/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"Bert (Herbert) Le Vack earned the nickname the 'Wizard of Brooklands'.

Billy Wells began importing Indians into the UK in May of 1909 at the urging of George Hendee. Billy was familiar with the Irishman because Charles was on the British team for the Coupe International races of 1905. He competed on a \"special\" of his own design powered by a J.A.P. V-twin engine and although he failed to finish the race,he became the first Irishman to participate in international motorcycle competition. Franklin was also on the British International team in 1906 with the Collier brothers Harry and Charlie on their Matchless'. He missed out on the inaugural Isle of Man TT race in 1907 but competed in the 1908 IOM on another of his JAP engined \"specials\" this time a single cylinder machine with which he took 6th place. For the 1909 TT Franklin rode a Triumph motorcycle placing 5th. The 1909 TT was the second year Indian V-Twins raced the TT and Guy Lee Evans's close second place finish against the Collier brothers and their Matchless' may have convinced Charles that Indian motorcycles were the way to go. Whatever his reasons Franklin entered the 1910 TT as a privateer on an Indian V-twin with the support of Billy Wells the UK importer. Even though he didn't finish the race (crashing into a stone wall) Franklin was still impressed with the Indian enough to return to England, quit his day job at the Rathmines power station and become an Indian motorcycle dealer. And thus began Charles Franklin's journey with Indian motorcycles. Charles would go on to design motorcycles for Indian including the original Indian Scout of 1920, the original Indian Chief of 1922, and the Indian 101 Scout of 1928.<br>ref:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Franklin\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Franklin</a></p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"0054f491-73b3-438e-9afb-1d6861b2ec68":{"id":"0054f491-73b3-438e-9afb-1d6861b2ec68","index":14,"created_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","updated_by":"ba9cc1d8-7788-42e8-8319-315197e122c3","created_at":"2016-07-24T03:23:27.016Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T06:43:04.031Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-24-matchless-motorcycles-dominated-racing-on-the-isle-of-man-in.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"matchless-motorcycles-dominated-racing-on-the-isle-of-man-in/index.html","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"Matchless Motorcycles dominated racing on the Isle of Man in the early days.
